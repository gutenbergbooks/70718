<p>So well known now is this little annual cyclopedia of facts in agriculture,
manufactures, commerce, politics, literature, science and the arts, that this
sixth volume of <span class="smcap">Our Curiosity Shop</span> needs no preface, except to make due
acknowledgments to the many who have aided the editor with information, and
to explain to such of its readers as are not yet fully advised of this fact, that
these pages constitute but a part of the several columns of questions and
answers published every week in the <span class="smcap">Daily</span>, <span class="smcap">Semi-Weekly</span> and <span class="smcap">Weekly</span>
editions of <span class="smcap">The Inter Ocean</span>. To have all such answers for the year, one
must be a regular subscriber to, and reader of, the paper. Hundreds of disputes,
raised in political gatherings, in debating societies, in Sunday schools,
in social and sporting circles, at the village postoffice when waiting for the
mail, on railway cars, in club rooms, around pioneer camp-fires, and in all kinds
of places are referred to <span class="smcap">The Inter Ocean</span> for amicable settlement. When
none of the several thousand books on the shelves of <span class="smcap">The Inter Ocean</span> and
the Chicago Public Library give response to such questions, original sources
of information are appealed to; and, again therefore, the grateful acknowledgments
of the editor of <span class="smcap">Our Curiosity Shop</span> are very heartily made to
the Heads of the several executive departments at Washington and many of
their chiefs of bureaus, to State and city officials, to his obliging associates of
<span class="smcap">The Inter Ocean</span> staff, and to that daily companion and efficient assistant,
his daughter.</p>

<p>Every answer given here is in response to at least one person enough
interested to call it forth. Not one started up at the editor’s own bidding, but
each of them might use the speech put into the mouth of King Philip of
Pokanoket, when summoned to meet the General Court of New Plymouth:
“You sent for me, and I am here.” So, being here in response to popular call,
the editor hopes this volume will have as cordial a welcome as the public has
accorded to its predecessor of last year, of which, already, the second edition
is nearly exhausted, and to the still earlier volumes of 1878 to 1882, inclusive.
It is now a matter of regret that the volumes of 1878 and 1879 were not
stereotyped, as all succeeding volumes have been; since that fact renders it
impossible for the Publishers to supply the repeated calls for the entire series
of six volumes. Readers will take note that the first two are out of print, but
all the others will be supplied as fast as called for.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">NATURE’S STORM SIGNALS.</p>

<p>Recent questions and answers in Our Curiosity
Shop about the aurora borealis and the Government
Signal Service have moved S. H. Ruple,
M., M. D., of Oquawka, Ill., to give the result of
his observations as follows:</p>

<p>Falling weather follows the aurora borealis, because
the lower stratum of the atmosphere at
such a time is sufficiently rarified for the manifestation
of aqueous vapor, as is indicated by
the evolution or liberation of so great a quantity
of electricity as is necessary to produce conspicuous
and extensive “northern lights.” A continuous
south wind, in most localities, will in a
few days cause rain, because by its warmth it
rarifies the cooler and denser atmosphere of
more northern or elevated localities, and reduces
its capability of sustaining moisture. A
continuous north wind dispels all rain
signs for the time being. This is no
new theory. Solomon, 3,000 years ago,
put it on record in Western Asia. (Prov. xxv.,
23.) And a careful observation during twenty-five
years has convinced me that it is true for
this age and country as well as for his. Flaky
clouds, or low-running ones, from any direction
but the north, denote rain or snow. Salmon,
leaden, or silvery colored clouds denote falling
weather; bright red, clear. When the sunset is
followed by bright lances or streaks of light of
various hues radiating from the point where the
sun disappeared, continuing across the heavens
and converging to a common point in the opposite
horizon, there exists a storm-cloud in line
with the sun, though it may be so distant as to
be for awhile entirely hidden from view by the
rotundity of the earth. If the rays of light are
evenly divided north and south of the line between
the observer and the radiating point,
and continue so till they have faded
out, the cloud is approaching. A few years
since the writer, becoming interested in an
exhibition of this phenomena, sat up to watch
the results of his calculations. About 1 a. m. the
storm (a moderate cyclone) reached the Mississippi
River, about five miles north of his residence,
having, according to telegraphic reports,
crossed the State of Iowa in five hours and a half.
When “heat lightning” is visible you may be
sure that there is a storm-cloud in the same direction,
though you may neither see it nor hear
the thunder. When the lightning is continuous
and very brilliant the storm may be regarded
as a violent one. In this event the track of the
destructive elements may be from 100 to 200
miles away. Some five years ago the writer’s attention
was called, a little after dark, to an extraordinary
display of heat lightning in the
southern horizon, and he ventured the opinion
that a devastating cyclone was traveling eastwardly,
probably in the vicinity of St. Louis.
Though residing in Oquawka, Ill., fourteen
miles above Burlington, Iowa, within twenty-four
hours <span class="smcap">The Inter Ocean</span>, ever watchful and
intelligent, was in his hands with telegraphic
reports corroborating his theory and predictions.
Jefferson Barracks were reported damaged by
the cyclone, and across in Illinois a whole village
was laid waste and several lives lost. This
was, to say the least, pretty accurate guessing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
If the old pioneers of Colorado, traveling at the
rate of twenty-five miles a day, had to toil from
five to seven days after catching their first view
of the snow-cap of Pike’s Peak before gaining
the mountain foot hills, how far off may not one
see the intensely white, dazzling, and flashing
illumination capping a cloud that is from three
to five miles above the earth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Lidell’s Grove</span>, Ill.<br>
</p>

<p>Please state some facts regarding leprosy and the
leper settlement on the Hawaiian Islands. Is the
same disease prevalent among the Chinese in California?
Are Caucasians liable to contract the disease?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">S. Gray.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There is no other malady so loathsome
and so dreaded among mankind as the
terrible disease of leprosy. A little blotch appears,
often on the face of the victim, which
gradually extending covers the whole body.
Scales drop from the sufferer; his limbs become
frightfully swollen, his voice grows hoarse, his
eyes almost burst from their sockets, as the irresistible
decay saps his life’s blood. While
thus afflicted the victim suffers no physical inconvenience,
except the gradual loss of his
limbs. His body is numb and he
does not feel the hand of the destroyer;
his appetite is as good as ever,
and he sleeps with as much relish as he did
when he was in health. But in Eastern countries
that which is almost as unbearable as
the disease itself is the leper’s exclusion from
society, even from that of his nearest relatives.
In most countries leprosy operates as a divorce
of husband and wife. Although it does
not fill the air with contagion, yet the possible
inoculation by personal contact or by handling
the same objects, has led to the banishment of
lepers not only from communities but from
their homes. Whatever discussion may still be
maintained as to the contagiousness of leprosy
there exists no reasonable doubt of its transmission
by heredity or licentiousness. During
the past twenty years and more the Hawaiian
Islands have received a large influx of Chinese
coolies of the basest sort through the coolie
traffic. Many of these associated in the loosest
manner with the lower classes of natives, and in
1868 the authorities awakened to the fact that
leprosy was spreading at an alarming rate. They
determined on the Asiatic remedy of isolation.
The western portion of the island of Molokai
was selected for this purpose, and here to-day
are found over 2,000 lepers shut out from all
hope of ever seeing their friends, unless
the latter become similarly afflicted.
Three times a week a steamer visits
the island, carrying provisions and
mail, and the latest victims. Among these
sufferers is William Ragsdale, the
first Governor of the colony. In California a
few of the Chinese have been afflicted with the
disease, but it is not considered prevalent
among them. In Salem, Mass., there is a pitiable
case. Charles Derby was living in the
Hawaiian Islands, when a slight blotch on his
left temple revealed to the experienced islanders
the fact that they had among them another
leper. To escape banishment, Mr. Derby sailed
for San Francisco; but was offered no refuse
there, that city following the example of Honolulu.
He then went to Salem, where they knew
nothing of the disease, and there remained until
discovered by two medical students from the
Hawaiian Islands. His swollen and decaying
face presents a frightful appearance. What is
to be done with him is a question which the
Salem authorities have not yet decided upon.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Lowell</span>, Mich.<br>
</p>

<p>I am informed, on what appears to be good authority,
that the aurora borealis has been seen for only
about two hundred years, and that we have no record
of its previous appearance. Is such the case?</p>

<p class="right">
W. A. D.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The aurora borealis is not a phenomenon
peculiar to modern times. The ancients
used to call it chasmata, bolides and
trabes, names which expressed the different colors
of the lights. The scarlet aurora was looked
upon by the superstitious barbarians as an omen
of direful slaughter; so it is not unusual for
descriptions of bloody battles to contain allusions
to northern lights. In the annuls of
Cloon-mac-noise it is recorded that in 688 A. D.,
accompanying a terrible battle between Leinster
and Munster, Ireland, a purple aurora lit
the northern skies, foretelling the slaughter.
To the Latins and Greeks of Southern Europe
the phenomenon rarely appeared, and therefore
their writings are almost, if not entirely, silent
concerning it, yet it was not unknown to them.</p>

<span class="smcap">Virgil City</span>, Mo.<br>

<p>In what part of the world was the Garden of Eden
located?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">C. A. Sharp.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—This is still a matter of dispute
among Biblical scholars of the highest reputation.
Some have endeavored to locate it by
means of the fruits and mineral productions
named in the description given in the second
chapter of Genesis, verses 8-17. But the main
question in the opinion of most investigators is,
What are the four rivers mentioned? The weight
of tradition and scholarly study inclines to an
agreement that the Tigris and Euphrates, which,
after flowing in a southeasterly direction, unite
and empty into the Persian Gulf, are the third
and fourth rivers mentioned in the sacred word.
But those who agree so far differ widely as to
what rivers should be regarded as the Pison and
Gihon. Some affirm that the River Pison is the
Ganges, and the Gihon the sacred river of
Egypt: others that the Garden of Eden was located
on the high table-lands of Armenia, from
which rise the Tigris and Euphrates. By choosing
two rivers which flow into the Caspian Sea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
or by giving the name Gihon to one river, and
the name Pison to the sea, and extending the
boundaries of Eden so as to take in these waters
and the head-waters of the Euphrates and
Tigris, they consider that they have
solved the mystery that veils the cradle
of our race. The fact that all the
European races of the Aryan family, and also
the Semitic races, trace back their origin to this
region gives color to this solution. A few
scholars of some distinction have argued that
the Adamic paradise was in the vicinity of the
mountains of the Moon in Africa, regarding the
Nile as the Pison, and the Niger as the Gihon,
and reconciling it with the views of former
scholars by affirming that the Assyrian rivers at
that time had their source in the mountains of
the Moon, but flowed underneath the ground to
their apparent source in the continent of Asia.
Others locate Eden in the vicinity of the ancient
city of Babylon, considering the doubtful rivers as
the two channels by which the united Tigris and
Euphrates empty into the Persian Gulf. But
two things have not been explained by any of
these theories. The four rivers flow from one
river, and the River Pison “compasseth the whole
land of Havilah.” Until these questions are
solved the location of the Garden of Eden will
continue to remain a mystery.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">THE GLACIAL PERIOD.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Hebron</span>, Neb.<br>
</p>

<p>Please give some information in regard to what geologists
term the ice or glacial period. What evidence
have they that such a period ever existed?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">James Knox.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The loose soil which covers so large
a part of the surface of the northern continents
to a depth varying from 30 to 100 feet, over
which lie the vegetable deposits of later ages,
is considered by geologists the effect of glaciers
that in the quaternary, or latest geological age,
slowly moved southward across the country.
Upon examination it is found that the erratic
boulders scattered over the Western prairies
and other northern regions are unlike the native
rock of the same region, being entirely foreign
to the localities where they now appear. Sometimes
the nativity of the rock is traced
hundreds of miles north of where it now rests
showing that some powerful agency has carried
it southward. Again, if the native rock be uncovered
and closely examined, it will be observed
to be polished and grooved with parallel
marks, running north and south, as if chiseled
out by some coarse and heavy instrument.
These marks are attributed to sharp, hard rocks
projecting through the lower surfaces of the
moving glaciers. That glaciers do produce such
markings is proven by examination of the rocks
which the moving ice fields of Switzerland and
other glacial regions have worn and are marking
to-day; also, the general appearance of the loose,
unstratified, heterogeneous deposit is similar to
that of the moraines that the modern glaciers
leave as they slowly melt away. Geologists are
generally agreed that long before the advent of
man parts of the northern hemisphere were elevated
several thousand feet higher than they are
at present, causing the cold of the arctic zone
to extend far southward into the present temperate
regions, and that a vast glacier rising
in the vicinity of Hudson Bay covered our whole
continent north of the 40th parallel. In New
York and other Eastern States the rocks are
scratched from a northwesterly direction, in
Ohio from a northerly, and in Iowa from a
northeasterly direction, showing in each State
the direction of the origin of the glacier. Afterward
there followed a subsidence to a few hundred
feet below the existing level, followed by a
gradual elevation to the situation of the present
era. These elevations and subsidences are evidenced
by stratification and fossil remains.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The lower portion of Manhattan
Island was incorporated as a city under the
original Dutch regime, in 1652. Charles
II. of England, claiming all the country from the
French possessions south to Florida and west to
the Pacific as belonging to the English crown,
granted a charter covering New York to his
brother, the Duke of York, who suddenly appeared
before New Amsterdam and took unopposed
possession in August, 1664. The name of
the city was changed to New York. The Dutch
recovered the place in August, 1673, and changed
its name to New Orange. The next year it was
restored by treaty to the English, and ever since
it has kept the name of the city of New York.
Since the office of mayor was created there have
been seventy-two mayors, of whom the first one
elected by the people was Cornelius W. Lawrence.
Since Oakey Hall’s administration
the following persons have held
this office: Wm. F. Havemeyer, Wm. H.
Wickham, Smith Ely, Edward Cooper, Wm. R.

<p>When were the present tariff duties passed? Was it
not when Congress was Democratic? Are the duties
now greater or less than formerly?</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The first United States tariff law on
imported goods was approved July 4, 1798. A
small tax was then imposed, according to the
suggestion of Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of
the Treasury, upon sugar, coffee, tea, salt, manufactured
iron, glass and wool, silk goods, and
several articles of minor importance. While the
rate of duty has fluctuated, the general tendency
has been toward an increase. This is shown by
the different enactments from 1832 to the present
time. In the latter year the duty on sugar
was made 2½ cents per pound; in 1841, 20
per cent; in 1842, 2½ cents per pound; in 1846,
30 per cent; in 1857, 24 per cent; in March,
1861, ¾ cent per pound; in August, 1861, 2
cents per pound; in December, 1861, 2½ cents
per pound; in 1862, 3 cents per pound; while
the present rate ranges, according to grade,
from 57½ to 61¾ per cent. In 1832 the
duty on woolen manufactures was 50 per
cent; in 1841, 20 per cent ad valorem; in
1842, 40 per cent; in 1857, 24 per cent;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
in March, 1861, 25 per cent and 12 cents
per pound; in 1862, 30 per cent and 18 cents
per pound; in 1864, 40 per cent and 24 cents
per pound; in 1867, 35 per cent and 50 cents
per pound, while the present duty upon woolen
imports ranges, according to value, between 41
and 80 per cent. The same gradual increase is
observable in silks, which in 1832 were admitted
on an ad valorem duty of 10 per cent;
in 1841, 20 per cent; in 1842, $2.50 per pound,
changing in the same year to 25 per cent. In
1857 it was 19 per cent; in March, 1861, 30 per
cent; in August, 1861, 30 per cent; in 1864, 60
per cent, and in 1881, 58 to 70 per cent. With
the exception of a few years when Andrew Jackson
was President, the different Congresses,
Democratic as well as Republican, have sustained
the duties upon the imports of this
country. While the Republicans are mainly responsible
for whatever is good or bad in our
present tariff laws, Democratic Representatives
from manufacturing districts have of late years,
as a rule, given cheerful aid to the maintenance
of a protective tariff.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It is used by jewelers to express

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">E. E. Davis.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The history of phrenology is embodied
in the lives of its expounders. Although
the prominent thinkers of mediæval Europe
acknowledged many of its principles, it was not
until 1796 that phrenology found an able and
persistent advocate. Franz Joseph Gall, who in
1758 was born in Baden, began in his childhood
to study the human face and head, and
connect the various dispositions of men with
certain prominences noticeable in the shape of
their skulls. He studied medicine at various
colleges, receiving his degree at Vienna. Eleven
years after his graduation he delivered a lecture
in that city, expounding his views on the subject
which had been his constant study. It was
not well received, and his subsequent writings
and lectures were subjected to considerable
censure and ridicule. They were, indeed, to
such an extent unpopular that in 1805 the
Austrian Government interdicted them, and he
was compelled to refrain from further advancing
his views in that country. With Kasper Spurzheim,
a talented young man, who had embraced
his doctrines while attending the school of medicine
in Vienna, Dr. Gall changed his abode to
Paris. In that city, with the aid of his pupil, he
succeeded in making a considerable impression.
He afterward became a citizen of France, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
died in 1828, near Paris, leaving several works
valuable to the student of phrenology. In the
meantime Dr. Spurzheim visited England. His
lectures were listened to with considerable interest
and many in that country adopted his
views. In 1832 he came to the United States;
but soon after his first lecture, which had
created quite a sensation, he died in Boston.
His efforts in England and Scotland were continued
by George Combe, a lawyer, who wrote
and lectured in those countries, and who also
visited the United States. But he to whom
most credit is due for extending the tenets of
phrenology in this country is Oscar Squire
Fowler, who was born at Cohocton, N. Y., Oct.
11, 1809, was educated at Amherst College, and
has spent most of his life in advocating his
views. In 1876 he made his home at Boston,
although much of his time was spent in lecturing
in various parts of the land. Although one
of the fundamental principles of phrenology is
that the mind is material and inseparable from
the body, yet many who deny such a conclusion
accept some of its inferences.</p>

J. M.<br>
</p>

already been expended and that the ultimate
cost of the building would be fully $20,000,000.
With all this lavish expenditure the State House

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—William Cecil Burleigh, who, Hume
declares, was the “most vigilant, active and prudent
Minister ever known in England,” was
born in Lincolnshire in 1520. He studied law
and graduated at Cambridge. When only 28
years old, he became Secretary of State, but at
the accession of the Catholic Queen Mary he resigned.
Although he was a stanch supporter
of the Protestant cause, he was one of the few
who was not persecuted. When Queen Elizabeth
in 1558 succeeded her sister, Burleigh again
assumed control of the state and became virtually
the Prime Minister. For forty years he
retained this office, until his death. To his ability
much of the credit of Elizabeth’s wise and
prosperous reign is due. He was a man in whom
“the Virgin Queen” could place entire confidence.
He was rewarded in 1571 with a barony and in
the following year was made Lord Treasurer.
His rule has been severely criticised in some
particulars, and especially as regards his treatment
of Mary, Queen of Scots; but his integrity
and statesmanship have never been called in
question by well-informed, impartial historians.</p>

writings of Torquato Tasso?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">H. B. Glassco.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Torquato Tasso, the unfortunate
Italian poet, was born in 1544. With the intention
of practicing law he studied at Naples,
Rome, and afterward at Bergamo. The wonderful
popularity of his first poem, “Rinaldo,”
written when only 18 years old, led him to abandon
jurisprudence and devote himself entirely to
literary pursuits. This production was a
lively epic composed of twelve cantos,
full of the romance of mediæval times.
Soon after he began to labor on his “Gerusalemme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Liberata,” or Jerusalem liberated, his
chief work, which he completed in 1575. He was
for a time in great favor at court and in the Vatican,
and the Pope bestowed many favors upon
him, and King Alfonso II. gave him a pension.
The Duke of Ferrara became his especial patron,
and treated him as a member of his household,
until Tasso conceived an uncontrollable affection
for the Duke’s daughter, which she did not
reciprocate, while the Duke was offended. In
despair he yielded to melancholy, which soon
grew into a species of insanity, so that it became
necessary to remove him to the home of his
sister. Here he partially recovered, but he
would not be satisfied until again admitted
to the Duke of Ferrara’s household,
where his malady returned, and
the Duke, in 1579, removed him to an insane
asylum. There he remained seven years, while
all Italy was singing his praises. After his release
he resided at Mantua, and then at Naples.
In 1594, the Pope, Clement VIII., invited him to
come to Rome and be crowned; but before he
could go to receive the promised honors, he died,
April 25, 1595. Two of his dramatic poems
“Aminta” and “Torrismondo,” were received
with great favor; but that which contributed
most to his fame was the “Gerusalemme
Liberata,” translated into the English by Edward
Fairfax as early as 1600 and by J. K. James as
late as 1865. Tasso takes rank among Italian
poets next after Dante.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Samuel J. Randall is undoubtedly
one of the leading spirits in his party. He is
a shrewd, sagacious politician rather than a
great statesman, but in statesmanship he is one
of the prominent figures on the Democratic side
of the House. He is shrewd enough to know
that a Democrat of out-and-out free-trade professions
would have no encouragement to aspire
to any office in the gift of Pennsylvania, but besides
this it is only fair to grant him credit for
knowing that it would be ruinous to the enormous
mining, manufacturing, and farming interests
of his State for this country to practice
free trade. So he has been instrumental
in keeping a considerable following
of Democrats who will vote with him
against violent reductions in the present tariff.
Mr. Randall is a Philadelphian by birth. He
was born Oct. 10, 1828; received a fair academic
education; was for a time engaged in mercantile
business; was for four years a member of the
City Council; then a member of the State Senate
for a year; was elected to the Thirty-eighth
Congress, and has held membership in the
House ever since. In the election of 1880 he carried
his district by 13,661 votes, against 9,880
for B. L. Berry, Republican, and he was re-elected
last November by a still larger majority.
He has sat on several of the most important
committees in the House; was Speaker for the
last session of the Forty-fourth Congress, for
the Forty-fifth and the Forty-sixth Congresses,
and has a fair prospect of being Speaker of the
next Congress.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—A German may be a Jew, or a Jew a
German, Englishman, Frenchman, Italian,
American, or of any nationality under the sun.
As a Jew his nationality embraces the world; in
many respects he still observes the laws of
Moses, and by marriage and other peculiar institutions
he maintains his race distinctions
and national feelings. At the same time he is
now in most Christian states a citizen of the
land he happens to be born in, and in most such
lands is permitted to enjoy all the rights of
other citizens, as is the case with American
Jews. It was not always so. It is only since
the establishment of the German Empire, in
1871, that the Jew has enjoyed full civil equality
in Germany. France granted it in 1790, and
confirmed this grant in the constitution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
1795. In all but a few petty, contemptible
particulars, since 1858 English Jews have enjoyed
all the privileges of other British subjects.
In Russia and some other European
countries the Jew is still denied the rights of
citizenship.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The island of St. Helena, whose
name always recalls the gloomy downfall of
Napoleon I., contains an area of about forty-seven
miles. It supports a population of 6,241
souls. It was discovered in 1501 by Juan de Nova
Castella, a bold Portugese navigator, who gave it
the name St. Helena, because he first saw it on
the day sacred to that saint in the Romish calendar.
In the following century the Dutch took
possession and retained it until England
seized it in 1673. When Napoleon Bonaparte
was first banished to this island and held here as
a political prisoner under British surveillance,
the population was but about 800,200 of whom
were soldiers and 300 slaves. The importance
to a maratime nation like Great Britain of St.
Helena, lying as it does in the path of European,
South African, Australian, and India and China
trade, developed as years passed: its value as a
naval station and its other strategic advantages
have become more and more apparent, and now
it is looked upon as one of the strong keys of
English power in the South Atlantic.</p>

of the whites was plainly magnified over that of
an equal number of whites in the free States.
For example, the first Congressional apportionment
allowed one representative for every 30,000
inhabitants; but in the South 21,000 whites
owning 15,000 slaves counted the same as 30,000
whites in the North where there were no

were granted the same representation in Congress

<p>Please give a brief biography of Thomas Jefferson.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Son of Vulcan.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—“Thomas Jefferson, author of the
Declaration of American Independence, of the
statute of Virginia for religious freedom, and
father of the University of Virginia,” is the inscription
upon Jefferson’s tombstone. He was
born April 2, 1743, in the county of Albemarle,
in the interior of Virginia, then a desolate forest.
His diligence and study was encouraged by his
parents, who placed him under the care of a talented
Scottish clergyman. When he was 17 he
entered William and Mary College, and
after graduation studied law. In 1759 he was
chosen to represent his county in the House of
Burgesses, where he continued with but little
interruption until the days of the revolution.
Like George Washington, disappointed in his
first love, he married a widow, in 1772. Three
years later he was sent as a delegate to the Second
Continental Congress. As Chairman of the
committee to draft the Declaration of Independence,
he is said to have written the whole
of that document, which, with a few minor
amendments, was adopted by Congress and
sent to the King of England. In October he resigned
and retired to his farm, but only again
to be forced into civil life by his
election to the State Legislature. During the
war he was not only busy in originating and advocating
measures to aid the cause of liberty
but also he began a thorough revision of the
statutes of Virginia. From 1779 to 1781 he
served as Governor. After a short term in the
House of Burgesses he was sent to the Confederate
Congress, which, in 1784, thought fit to
appoint him as one of the three commissioners
to negotiate treaties with European nations.
Upon Franklin’s return Jefferson was made
Minister Plenipotentiary to the court
of Louis XVI. He watched with
eager interest the progress of the French
Revolution, and when given a leave of absence
in 1789 returned filled with democratic ideas
from the new republic. Upon his landing he
was immediately tendered by Washington a
position in his Cabinet as Secretary of State.
Soon it became evident to Jefferson that among
the President’s advisers there existed a radical
difference of opinion on nearly every important
subject. Hamilton was regarded by the Secretary
of State as a man in favor of a constitutional
monarchy, and the latter’s ideas of centralization
were construed to mean the destruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
of the existing Constitution and the formation
of a government like that of England. The
Secretary of the Treasury, on the other hand,
believed Jefferson to be infused with the socialistic
democracy of France, and one whose
principles if put in practice would
overthrow the Constitution and produce anarchy.
To Jefferson the financial policy of
Hamilton was very aggravating. The recommendations
of the Treasurer to Congress he believed
to be in the interest of the speculators
and the moneyed classes. On New Year’s Day,
1794, he resigned his office, greatly to the annoyance
of Washington, who was reluctantly
compelled to acquiesce, and returned to his
farm. The position occupied by the first President
was a peculiarly embarrassing one. He
had in his Cabinet Jefferson and Randolph, the
leaders of the Republican, or Anti-Federal
party, and Hamilton and Knox prominent Federalists.
With such associations the administration
as a whole was comparatively
little criticised, although Hamilton and
Jefferson were the targets for the denunciations
of their respective opponents. In 1800
Jefferson and Burr each received 73 electoral
votes to Adams’ 65, which threw the election into
the House. According to the decision of that body
Jefferson was inaugurated March 4, 1801. His
frugal administration increased the popularity
of his party, which continued to remain in power
twenty-four years. After having served two
terms he again retired to his farm, a poor man,
considerably burdened with debt. Congress
purchased his library, which their committee
valued at $23,000, although its cost had been
nearly double that sum. Mr. Bacon, who had
charge of the removal, says that there
were sixteen wagon loads, each wagon
being required to carry at least 3,000 pounds.
The remainder of his life he spent in endeavoring
to introduce schools and colleges, and in
general, the New England system of local government
into his native State. After witnessing
the establishment of the University of Virginia,
he died July 4, 1826, upon the same day that
John Adams passed away. In politics Jefferson
was considered by the Federalists as a theorist.
Speaking of his administration, Gouverneur
Morris says: “There is just now so much philosophy
among our rulers that we must not be
surprised at the charge of pusillanimity.” In
religion he was very bitter against the Calvinists,
and held Unitarian views.</p>

</p>

<p>What is mica, and where is it found?</p>

<p class="right">
B. O. B.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Mica consists of a silicate of
alumina, combined, according to species, with
small proportions of potash, soda, lithia,
oxide of iron, oxide of manganese, etc. The
most common and serviceable variety is known
as potash mica. It is a constituent
of granite, gneiss, mica slate, and several
other kindred rocks. It is
found both disseminated and in veins.
It is very widely distributed, especially in composition
with other minerals; but there are comparatively
few localities where it is known to
exist in such quantities and form as to be mined
with profit. Its most valuable form is that of
muscovite, in which it appears in translucent
lamina or plates. The larger and clearer these
plates the greater the value of the mine or
quarry. In Siberia they have been found more
than three feet across, and they have been obtained
of great size in Sweden and Norway. This
is also the case at Acworth, Grafton, and
Alstead, N. H., and mica has been found large
enough for economic use in Canada. Mica is
used largely for the doors of stoves and the sides
of lanterns. It is employed in some countries
as a substitute for window glass, and its toughness
recommends it for this purpose on board
vessels of war. It has also been used for spectacles.
When ground it makes a cheap bronzing
powder. There are some mica factories in North
Carolina, near Mitchell County mica mines. In
the state of a fine powder it is used to give a
brilliant appearance to walls, and as a sand for
drying ink on manuscripts. Lithia mica contains
a small proportion of lithia, which
gives it in many cases a fine rose or peachblow
color, so that it is used for ornamental purposes.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">M. M. McKee.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The act establishing the old United
States Bank, although opposed by the Secretary
of State, Thomas Jefferson, and by Edmund
Randolph, the Attorney General, on the ground
of its unconstitutionality, was approved by
President Washington, July 25, 1791. The bank
was organized at Philadelphia. The different
clauses declared that the capital should be $10,000,000,
which should be divided into 25,000
shares of $400 each; that any person, copartnership
or body politic might subscribe for
any number of shares not exceeding 1,000—only
the United States could subscribe for
more than this number of shares; that, with the
exception of the United States, the subscriptions
should be payable one-fourth in gold and silver,
and the remaining three-fourths in certain
6 per cent bonds of the United States; that the
subscribers should be incorporated under the
name of “The President, Directors, and company
of the Bank of the United States,” and the
organization should continue until March 4,
1811; that the bank could hold property of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
kinds, inclusive of its capital, to the amount of
$15,000,000; that twenty-five directors should
be chosen, who in turn should choose from their
number a President; that as soon as
$400,000 in gold and silver was received
on subscription the bank could organize, after
giving a notice of its intention. The general
effect of this institution was very salutary. The
credit of the United States became firmly established.
The bank notes stood at par with gold
and silver. The large deposits made the money
available for the use of the Treasury, and the
State bank currency, which had flooded the
country, with no prospects of redemption, was
greatly reduced. But with all its recognized advantages
the act to re-charter was defeated in
1811, by the casting vote of the Vice President,
George Clinton. Its loss, however, was immediately
felt in the sudden and rapid increase of
the currency of the State banks. To ward off
an impending crisis, the second bank was established
by an act approved by President Madison,
April 10, 1816, at Philadelphia. A capital
of $35,000,000 was required, which was to be
equally divided into 350,000 shares, of which
the United States took 70,000. The charter extended
to March 3, 1836. It was prohibited from
lending on account of the United States more
than $500,000, or to any prince or foreign
power any sum whatever, without the sanction
of law first obtained. The bank was also prohibited
from issuing bills of less denomination
than $5. In time, to facilitate business, branch
offices were established in every State. In December,
1829, however, the bank met strenuous
opposition in the message of President Jackson,
who argued, like Jefferson, against the constitutionality
of its charter. When Congress,
in 1832, passed a bill to re-charter the institution,
Jackson imposed his veto, and soon after
removed from the bank the United States’ deposits.
The bank corporation, however, continued
to exist, hoping that succeeding elections
would change the complexion of affairs before
their charter expired; but in this they were disappointed.
In 1836 the charter terminated,
and a few months afterward the business interests
of the country were overwhelmed in a most
disastrous financial revulsion.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—J. Fenimore Cooper, the pioneer
of American novelists, was born in Burlington,
N. J., Sept. 15, 1789. Reared in the wild country
surrounding Otsego Lake, he early became
acquainted with the natural scenery which he
afterward so vividly described. His father, who
was a member of Congress, sent him when but
13 to Yale College, where he remained two years.
At the age of 16 he joined the United States
navy, and made two extended cruises, which
gave him all the information he desired concerning
the sea. Resigning, he married,
and settled at Westchester, N. Y., where
he began to write his novels. The first,
“Precaution,” appeared in 1819, and from that
time he continued to write until his death, in
1851. In 1826 he visited Europe, returning in
1833. The novels of Cooper are considered remarkable
for their descriptions; but in the
general finish of his stories he has many superiors.
His histories, while they are fascinating
in interest, are not considered altogether
reliable. His principal works are “The Pioneers,”
“The Spy,” “The Pilot,” “The Prairie,”
“Naval History of the United States,” and “The
Pathfinder.”</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">D. D. Poitner.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The island of Mackinac, famed in
Indian legends and the early French and English
history of the West, was first visited by
white men in 1634, when John Nicollet and a few
Hurons and French voyageurs came to Green
Bay to make a treaty with the Indians of that
region. In 1670 that devout Jesuit missionary,
Jean Marquette, lived on this island for about
two years while building a chapel and dwelling
on a point opposite on the site of the present
Mackinac City. While here he wrote the following
description: “Missili-Mackinac is an island,
famous in these regions. It is of more than a
league in diameter, and elevated in some places
into such high cliffs as to be seen more than
twelve leagues off. It is situated just in the
strait forming the communication between
Lakes Huron and Illinois (Michigan). It is the
key and, as it were, the gate for all the
tribes from the south.” “This place is the most
noted in these regions for the abundance of its
fisheries; for, according to the Indian saying,
this is the home of the fishes.” The history of
this gem of the lakes is intertwined with that of
the old Mackinac town. This ancient village
was for many centuries the headquarters of the
Ottawa, Objibwa, and other Indian nations, and
when Marquette succeeded in winning their
friendship and in constructing his chapel, it
became the great trading post of the French-Canadians.
Soon a fort was constructed, and
the white foreigners lived here and traded in
peace. But when in 1759 Quebec was taken by
the English, Mackinac fell to the conquerors.
These new masters were very unpopular with
the suspicious inhabitants, who soon found an
opportunity to avenge their previous wrongs
and defeats by a complete massacre of
the garrison. In order to retain a
post in that locality and prevent a
repetition of such slaughter, the English constructed
in 1780 a fort on the island, which in
1793 was surrendered to the United States. In
the war of 1812 it was surprised before its
garrison was aware of the declaration of war and
surrendered to the English besiegers. Upon the
close of the struggle it was returned to the
jurisdiction of the United States. For many
years the island was the outfitting and furnishing
place of John Jacob Astors’ Indian
traffic, under the name of the Northwestern
Fur Company, but when that gentleman
sold out in 1834 to Ramsey Crooks, of New York,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the trade of the post gradually decreased. The
island is one of the most beautiful localities, in
its natural scenery and surroundings, of which
our country can boast. The clear water, the imposing
rocks, and the old fort, all add luster to
its many charms. One of its chief natural attractions
is Arch Rock, which, projecting from
the precipice on the northeastern side of the
island, forms a natural bridge 140 feet in height.
The bridge, the Indians say, was constructed by
the giant fairies, who formerly made the island
their abode, but the unpoetical scientist declares
that at one time the water was much higher
than in this age, and that its continuous action
wore away the calcareous rock, and left this
arch.</p>

<p>How many kinds of metals are there? For what are
they used; where found?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Laura.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There is a difference of opinion
among practical chemists as to the number of
existing metals. Professor Youmans affirms that
there are at least fifty simple metals, nearly one-half
of which are of little importance. Other
scientists make the number considerably less.
The greater number of metals are rarely or never
found in nature in a simple state. They exist in
compound forms, and are useful only in such
conditions. For example, sodium, the basis of
our common salt, cannot be exposed to any
moisture, and therefore in its simple state
is comparatively useless. Aluminum, as it is
found in the ordinary clay, or the alum of commerce,
is of great utility, but when separated
from its associated elements its use is confined
almost exclusively to the laboratory. Of the
more important metals iron is the king. In its
production Great Britain leads the world. From
her furnaces and mills in 1879 were taken 5,995,337
tons of cast and pig iron, and 1,344,297
tons of steel, a ton consisting of 2,240 lbs.
During the same year the United States produced
2,741,853 tons of iron, and 1,440,121 tons
of steel; Germany, 2,161,192 tons of iron and
800,000 tons of steel, and France, 1,344,759 tons
of iron and 561,691 tons of steel. Of the production
in the United States, Pennsylvania furnaces
yielded about one-half, and those of Ohio
about one-seventh. Copper has been in use from
early times. Often among the bones of primitive
man are found utensils beaten out of this
malleable metal. At present it is mined extensively
in Wales, Germany, Australia, Upper
Michigan, Northern Wisconsin and Minnesota,
and to a small degree in various other localities.
Tin is found either as rock-tin, in veins with
rock and other ores, or as stream-tin in alluvial
deposits. The principal mines are in Cornwall,
Germany, Hungary, Bohemia, Mexico and China.
Not only is it used in the manufacture of tin-plate,
but also in the composition of various
valuable alloys. Zinc, in the form of a carbonate
or selicate, is obtained from mines in Silesia and
Belgium, and also in small quantities in Wales,
France, and this country. Like tin, it is used
in the composition of various alloys, as
well as in the ordinary form of zinc
plate. Until a recent date, the value of nickel
was not known. The Germans, who, out of derision,
gave it its name, were accustomed to cast
it aside as a spurious or base copper. The mines
of Germany and Wales produce nearly the entire
amount, although a little has been obtained from
mines in Pennsylvania. Its use is mainly confined
to its alloys, such as German silver, white
metal, and a few minor coins. Platinum, which,
owing to its high fusive point and its lack of
affinity for acids is peculiarly adapted for the
manufacture of chemical vessels, is found in
Brazil, and also in Russia. In the production of
gold the United States leads all other countries.
The yield of our gold mines in 1881 was valued at
$36,500,000, while the total yield from 1845 to
1880 amounted to $1,523,678,301. Between the
years 1493 and 1875 Austria produced in gold
$889,963,800, New Granada $596,501,675, and
Russia $590,629,944. The silver of the world
for the last four centuries has been produced
mainly in Mexico, Peru, and Bolivia. Since the
discovery of America Mexican mines have
yielded over $2,600,280,659; Peruvian, $1,065,357,084;
and Bolivian, $1,286,999,947. The
mines of the United States have yielded since
their first discovery about $540,000,000. Mercury
is obtained either in the fluid state, inclosed in
the rocky receptacles of the earth, or is derived
by roasting its sulphate. In Southern California
and Mexico, and also in Austria and Spain, productive
mines are worked. It is valuable in the
construction of thermometers, barometers,
pendulums, etc., manufactures, and also in refining
metals by amalgamation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Please give a brief history of the right of suffrage in
this country.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The history of suffrage has been a
record of progress and extension. The most
limited form is observed in the first election of
the Virginia colony in 1607, and the most extensive
to-day is in Wyoming Territory. By the
charter granted to the Virginia Company the
members of a council of settlers, chosen by a
higher council resident in England, were privileged
to choose annually a President from
their own number. In accordance with this
the first right of suffrage that existed
in any permanent American colony
was exercised by six members of the council,
who, in May, 1607, chose Edward Maria Wingfield
as the first President. In 1619 the different
towns of Virginia elected, by general suffrage,
twenty-two burgesses, who, assembling
at Jamestown, constituted the first legislative
body convened in America. In the following
year, a few hundred miles north, the Plymouth
Fathers gathered on the deck of the Mayflower,
and exercised a still more extended right of
suffrage in the choice of John Carver as the first
Governor of the colony. These privileges continued,
with only a few changes in Virginia,
until the American revolution, excepting that
eighteen years after the election of Carver, in
Massachusetts, their mass assemblies were
deemed too large, and a representative government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
was established. Although democratic in
principle, a few laws passed by the New England
colonists restricted the privilege of suffrage.
No person who had not become a freeman by
taking the oath of allegiance was permitted to
vote. No man, according to a law of 1631, was
admitted to the freedom of the body politic who
was not a member of some of the churches
within the limits of the same. No
Quaker was permitted to become a
freeman. The two latter restrictions, however,
were soon removed. The power of the
people was greatly increased through the results
of the revolution, yet in several of the original
thirteen States the right of suffrage was restricted
to property-holders or rate-payers, and
otherwise limited for periods extending in some
cases through one or more decades of the present
century. The tendency was constantly to
the wide limits of manhood suffrage, which was
then prevailing rule, but only as regards white
citizens, until the fifteenth amendment in March,
1870, extended the same right to colored citizens.
The present movement toward the extension
of the right to women has been successful in
Wyoming Territory and to a certain extent in
Massachusetts, which permits women to vote
for members of the Board of Education. The
agitation, also, of the educational qualification
of electors has resulted in late years in a slight
limitation of the right of suffrage in a few of the
States, notably Massachusetts.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Eliza Cook, who is now residing in
the village of Merton in Surrey, England, was
born in Southwark in 1817. In early life she
established a considerable reputation through
the poems which she contributed to several of
the leading magazines of London. In 1840 these
poems were collected and with others published
in one volume, since which time she has issued
several editions of her lyrics that are read with

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—In June, 1777, a committee having
been appointed by Congress to confer with General
Washington concerning a design for a
National flag, reported in favor of a flag containing
thirteen stripes, alternately red and
white, and a blue field adorned with thirteen
white stars. This was adopted June 14, and
the design was carried to the upholstering shop
of Mrs. Ross, No. 239 Arch street, Philadelphia,
where the first National flag was made. The
original design required six-pointed stars, but,
upon Mrs. Ross’ suggestion that five-pointed
stars would be more symmetrical, the
pattern was changed. This lady was
afterward given the position of manufacturer
of government flags, which occupation
upon her death was retained by her children.
The stars and stripes were first unfurled at the
battle of Saratoga upon the occasion of the surrender
of Burgoyne. By an act of Congress, Jan.
13, 1794, the design was changed so as to incorporate
fifteen stripes and fifteen stars, and one
star was to be added for every subsequent State
admitted. This, however, was repealed in 1818,
when the original number of stripes were established,
the stars continuing to increase as
new States were admitted. In designing a flag
the field should be one-third the length and
cover the width of seven stripes. Of the
colors, red represents courage, white, integrity,
and blue steadfastness, faith and love.</p>

with a few drops of essence of musk and half as
much essence of ambergris. This is pressed
into cakes, ready for use. Brown ink may be
made with a strong decoction of catechu. The
shade can be varied by cautiously adding a little
weak solution of bichromate of potash. A yellow
ink may be made with a strong decoction of
yellow dyeing ingredient with alum and gum

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Ranal S. Mackenzie was born in New
York in August, 1840. Graduating from West
Point in 1862, he was made Second Lieutenant
of Engineers. He immediately entered active
service in the Ninth Corps, and was wounded at
the second battle of Bull Run. When Lee, in
1863, advanced into Maryland, Mackenzie was
very busily employed in constructing bridges
for the Union forces which followed in the rear
of the rebel army. He took part in the various
battles of the Army of the Potomac in Maryland
and in West Virginia, and in May, 1864,
had charge of a company before Richmond. He
passed through the battle of the Wilderness, and
in June was wounded before Petersburg. For
his gallantry he was appointed Brigadier General
of Volunteers. Resuming the command of
his company, he continued his efforts against
Petersburg. At the battle of Five Forks he commanded
a division of cavalry with so much skill
that he was brevetted Major General. After the
close of the war he retained the command of a
company in his old corps. In March, 1867, he
was promoted to the Colonelcy, and in 1870 he
was transferred to the cavalry and sent to the
Mexican frontier. In quelling the depredations
on the Texas border and in putting down the
Indian insurrections in New Mexico and Arizona<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
he has since displayed considerable military

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Commander-in-chief of the
rebel forces was born at Westmoreland, Va.,
Jan. 19, 1807. At the age of 18 he entered
West Point, from which he graduated, the
second in his class, in 1829. Receiving
an appointment of Second Lieutenant in the
Corps of Engineers, he spent his time at various
places, engaged in the government surveys, until
the breaking out of the Mexican war. During
the greater portion of the war he served under
General Scott, who considered him a very capable
officer. For his excellent services he was
brevetted major, then lieutenant colonel, and
soon afterwards he was made colonel. At
Chapultepec, he was wounded, but not seriously
enough to prevent his entering the City of Mexico.
After the war he was engaged on the Atlantic
coast until his appointment in 1852 to the
superintendency of the Military Academy. In
1855 he was made Lieutenant Colonel of the
Second Cavalry, and was transferred to the
Texas border. While on leave of absence in
Washington in 1859, he was placed in charge of
the troops which quelled the raid at Harper’s
Ferry. In March, 1861, he was made
colonel, but when he learned of Virginia’s
secession he resigned and accepted an appointment
in the insurrectionary forces of his native
State. Repairing to Richmond he was made
commander-in-chief of the forces of Virginia,
with the title of Major General. Soon after, by
an act of the Confederate Congress, he was made
third in rank of the entire rebel forces, Samuel
Cooper and A. S. Johnston being his superiors.
Because of his inactivity before Rosecrans he
was transferred in December to North and South
Carolina, where he remained until March, 1862,
when he returned to accept the position of commander-in-chief
of all the Confederate forces.
In June he defeated McClellan and began his
northward march, routing the forces of Pope
and invading the State of Maryland. The
bloody battle of Antietam was claimed
as a victory by both sides, but Lee thought
best immediately to retire into Virginia.
Until his next invasion and defeat at Gettysburg
in July, 1863, he remained on the defensive.
His subsequent retreat, his generalship
in the battle of the Wilderness and other
engagements following it disclosed great tact
and prudence. The ability which he displayed in
the defense of Richmond excites the admiration
of every impartial reader of history, and does
great credit to his military genius. This genius
was more than matched at last by that of General
Grant, sustained by the greater resources of
the North, and he was compelled to surrender
his sword at Appomattox Court House. Subsequently
he became President of Washington
and Lee College, located at Lexington, Va.,
where he died Oct. 12, 1870.</p>

<p>It is said that the companions of Christopher
Columbus were greatly alarmed when the variations

why the needle of a compass points north, and also
give the amount of its variation for different places.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">C. E. Locke.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Why the magnetic needle points
northward is not positively determined. There
are several theories but none of them explain all
the phenomena of the needle. That which perplexes
scientists most is that in every place the
needle is subject to variations. By observations
at Paris it was found that in 1681 the magnetic
needle varied 2 deg. 30 min. to the west, in
1865 18 deg. 44 min. to the west. At London
between 1580 and 1692 the needle varied from
10 deg. 15 min. E. to 6 deg. W. In
Dakota Territory the average variation is
12 deg. 30 min. east, in Minnesota 11 deg. east,
while in Montana it is 20 deg. east. S. V.
Clevenger, United States Deputy Surveyor, says
in a work on government surveys: “The needle
does not point due north, except in a few localities,
and at no place does it continue to point
with a given angular distance from the north,
for any stated length of time. It changes secularly,
annually, diurnally, and hourly, and is
further subject to fluctuations reducible to no
method of tabulation. In the vicinity of iron in
any shape, or magnetic sands, the needle is deflected
toward the material attracting it. This
perturbation is known as local attraction. The
author has known the needle to vary 5 deg. in a
distance of one mile, and 1 deg. 30 min. during
two hours when stationed at one place.” The
variation in the magnetic needle of Columbus’
compass was probably caused by some local attraction
of which he knew nothing.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Soon after the discovery of America

would be less dangerous and circuitous than
that usually traveled. Although the object of
polar expeditions has changed somewhat, yet
one of the reasons which actuated them influences
the explorers of the present time. The
nearness of this pole has rendered it of greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
interest than its southern counterpart.
Expeditions are fitted out more easily
for the shorter voyage. Relief can be
procured with less delay. Other reasons are
that from the closer neighborhood of the continents,
and from the action of the Gulf Stream
on the one side and the Japan current on the
other, and from the fact that the earth is in
perihelion during the winter season of the
Northern hemisphere, and in aphelion during
the winter of the Southern hemisphere, the
Arctic Sea is more free from ice, which in the
Antarctic region is an impregnable barrier in
the way of discovery.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Davenport</span>, Iowa.<br>
</p>

<p>Tell us something of the purpose of the great Clearing
House of London, and the amount of business
done through it.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">J. Brown.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Bankers’ Clearing House, London,
is the medium through which bankers collect
the checks and bills in their hands against
other banks. Instead of presenting these
checks and bills at each bank to
which they are addressed, and receiving
cash and notes in payment, clearing bankers
settle the whole amount delivered during the
day at this establishment in Postoffice Court,
Lombard street, by receiving or paying the
difference in the totals for or against them by a
single check on the Bank of England. Every
bank in London and the country is represented
by clearing bankers, and as their agents send
through the Clearing House all drafts payable in
the city and in the country, the amount passing
through this establishment every year is enormous.
The total amount for the year ending
April 30, 1882, was £6,382,654,000, or nearly
$32,000,000,000. The total clearings of the Bankers’
Clearing House, Chicago, in the year ending
Dec. 31, 1882, amounted to $2,366,526,185.
This represented only the transactions of banks
doing business in Chicago. It is estimated that
the new rule as to settlement applied during the
past year has reduced the total clearings nearly
25 per cent below what they would have been
under the old rule. London is the center of exchange
for the world, and the volume of its
bank clearings must necessarily be enormously
greater than that of any other city. The totals
of bills, checks, and drafts passed through
the London Clearing House, between 1869 and
1881 inclusive, foot up £68,010,643,000, or
over three hundred and forty billion dollars.
The rise and fall in trade not only in England,
but in large degree the world over is mirrored
in the annual records of these clearings for
the period mentioned. Whereas in 1869
the total clearings were but 3,626,396,000
pounds sterling, they increased each
year until 1873, when they amounted
to £6,070,948,000. Then, in consequence
of the widespread commercial depression the
total trade transactions fell off, and the London
bank clearings fell to £5,936,772,000 in 1874,
£5,685,793,000 in 1875, and £4,963,480,000 in
1876, the lowest point touched. Not until 1880
did the clearings rise to nearly six billions
again. In 1881, for the first time, did they reach
and pass the total in 1873, indicating general
business prosperity throughout the world.</p>

<p>How does American ship-building compare with
the ship-building of Great Britain?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">J. W. Nicodemus.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—During the year 1880 there were
constructed in the United States for ocean traffic
412 sailing vessels, having a tonnage of 53,610,
and 166 steam vessels, having a tonnage of 40,617.
In addition to this, for the service of the lakes
and rivers, were constructed forty-eight sailing
vessels, with a tonnage of 5,447 and 182 steamers,
with a tonnage of 38,237. In the same
period Great Britain constructed 353 sailing
vessels, with a tonnage of 57,534, and
474 steamers, with a tonnage of 346,361. The
total number of American vessels plying the
ocean was, at that time, 17,932, with a tonnage
of 2,803,923, while Great Britain boasted of
25,185 vessels and a tonnage of 6,574,513. Including
the shipping upon the inland lakes and
rivers, the total shipping of the United States
was 21,547 vessels, having a tonnage of 3,577,816.
The reason for this enormous difference between
the two countries is due partly to the
greater cost of labor and material in the United
States; partly to many more ways of employing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
capital profitably in the United States than
there are in other countries; partly to the subsidies
paid by the British Government to encourage
the establishment and maintenance of
British ocean lines of transportation; partly to
the vastness of the British Empire and the exemption
of British vessels and British goods
carried in their vessels from heavy port dues and
duties in trading to British ports; and partly
from the American law forbidding the granting
of the American flag to vessels built in other
countries, even when owned by American citizens,
and forbidding the restoration of our flag
to American-built vessels after they have once
gone under other colors, whatever the cause.
American-built vessels compare in all other respects,
except cost, favorably with the same
classes of British vessels, and in many particulars
American builders have done much to improve
all classes of sea-going craft.</p>

<p>What and where are some of the most celebrated
paintings?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—By general agreement among art
critics, Michael Angelo and Raphael stand at the
head of the line of master painters. Conspicuous
among the great paintings of the former are
“The Last Judgment,” “The Conversion of St.
Paul,” and “The Crucifixion of St. Peter;” and
among those of the latter, “The Dispute Concerning
the Sacrament,” the “Madonna di
Foligno,” and the “Madonna del Pesce, or Virgin
of the Fish.” The “Last Judgment” is a large
fresco painting, sixty feet high by thirty feet
wide, occupying the wall opposite the entrance
of the Sistine Chapel, in the Vatican Palace at
Rome. Over 300 figures are represented in “the
most violent attitudes and most admired disorder.”
“The Conversion of St. Paul” is another
large fresco painting in the Vatican. “The
Crucifixion of Peter,” also in the Vatican, is one
of the last from the hands of Angelo.
“The Dispute Concerning the Sacrament”
is a fresco representing,
above, a convocation of the saints around
the Almighty, the Savior, and the Virgin, enveloped
in heavenly glory, while beneath the
ceremony of the consecration of the sacrament
is depicted. This is found in the Camera della
Segnatura of the Vatican, Rome. “The Madonna
di Foligno,” in the Vatican gallery, derives its
name from the city of Foligno, which is represented
in the back-ground. The “Madonna del
Pesce,” now in the gallery at Madrid, Spain,
represents the Virgin and Child enthroned,
with St. Jerome on one side and on the other an
archangel with the young Tobit, who carries a
fish, from which circumstance the name is derived.
“The Madonna di San Sisto” is considered
by many critics the best of Raphael’s
works. It is located in the gallery of Dresden,
Germany, and represents the Madonna standing
upon the clouds surrounded with glory, holding
in her arms the eternal Son. Saint Sixtus
and Saint Barbara kneel at the sides. It was
originally painted on wood, but has been transferred
to canvas. The painting of “The Last
Supper,” by Leonardo da Vinci, is recognized as
one of the masterpieces. It was originally
painted by order of the Duke of Milan on the
walls of the refectory in the Dominican Convent
of the Madonna delle Grazie. The picture
is now in a state of decay, but several very fine
copies have been made; one of them, at the
Royal Academy, London, is considered almost,
if not quite, as good as the original. Rubens’
paintings of the “Descent from the Cross” and
“Elevation of the Cross,” at Antwerp, rank
high as masterpieces. The “Adoration of the
Trinity,” by Albert Durer, at Vienna, and his two
pictures containing life-size figures of Peter and
John, Mark and Paul, presented to the Council
of Nuremberg, Germany, are also very
famous. All of the above and many others, the
productions of painters barely less noted, are
classed as works of the great masters; and artists
and amateurs are constantly going on pilgrimages
to the temples and art galleries which are
so favored as to enshrine them.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—William Knox, a Scottish poet, familiar

born at Roxburgh in 1789. Very little has been
recorded concerning his life, which terminated
at the comparatively early age of 36. He was
very industrious, and in addition to his published
volumes contributed to the <cite>Literary Gazette</cite>
and to various other magazines. In 1818
he published a collection of poems under the
title of “The Lonely Heath,” and in the succeeding

<p class="right">

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—This noted humorist was an officer
in the regular army. His real name was George
Henry Derby. He was born in Massachusetts;
was appointed to the military academy from
that State, and graduated a second lieutenant
of ordnance in 1846; same year was transferred
to the Topographical Engineer Corps, a branch
of the army since abolished. Lieutenant Derby
was brevetted for gallantry at Cerro Gordo,
Mexico, being wounded in the action. He
was the author, over the nom de plume of
John Phœnix, of “Phœnixiana” (’56), and
the “Squibob Papers.” Many of his most popular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
productions were written while he was on
the staff of the commanding general of the Military
Department of the Pacific, engaged on the
improvement of the harbor of San Diego, Cal.,
which accounts for his being referred to as a
Californian writer. Captain Derby died May 15,
1861, in New York City, aged only 38.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">E. S. Capron.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The National Republicans, to whom
J. Quincy Adams belonged, dropped that name
and took the name of Whigs in 1832. Adams,
who was one of the Whig leaders from the first,
is usually classed as the first of the Whig Presidents,
because the National policy he represented
and maintained when President was
substantially the policy advocated by the Whigs
of 1832. In 1834 there was a State convention
held in New York City, which gave organized
form to the Whig party in that State, and this
organization became National in 1836, when
Wm. H. Harrison was first nominated by the
Whigs for the Presidency. A still higher degree
of organization was effected at the first delegate
National convention of the Whig party, held in
Harrisburg, Pa., Dec. 4, 1839, when Harrison
was nominated for the great campaign of 1840,

<p>Name the earliest American coins.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">E. Wilson.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The earliest coinage that can be
called American, in the sense of Anglo-American,
was ordered by the original Virginia Company,
only five years after the founding of
Jamestown. The coin were minted at Somers
Islands, now known as the Bermudas. For a
long while the standard currency of Virginia
was tobacco, as in many of the early settlements
of the Northwest it was beaver skins, and other
pelts reckoned as worth such a fraction of a
beaver skin or so many beaver skins. The accounts
of the fur traders and pioneers in their
dealings with the Indians were kept in beaver
skins instead of coin until some years after the
opening of this century, and in some parts of
the Dominion of Canada they are still kept so.
In 1645 the Assembly of the Virginia Colony,
after a preamble reciting that, “It had maturely
weighed and considered how advantageous a
quoine would be to this colony, and the great
wants and miseries which do daily happen unto
it by the sole dependency upon tobacco,” provided
for the issue of copper coins of the denominations
of twopence, threepence, sixpence,
and ninepence; but this law was never
carried into effect, so the first colonial coinage
of this country was that struck off by Massachusetts
under the order of the General Court
of that colony, passed May 27, 1652, creating a
“mint howse” at Boston, and providing for the
mintage of “12 pence, 6 pence, and 3 pence
pieces, which shall be for forme flatt, and
stamped on the one side with N. E., and on the
other side with XIId., VId., and IIId., according
to the value of each peece.” In 1662,
from this same mint appeared the famous “pine
tree shillings,” which were two-penny pieces.
This mint was maintained for thirty-four years.
In the reign of William and Mary copper
coins were struck in England for New England
and Carolina. Lord Baltimore had silver shillings,
sixpences, and fourpences made in England
to supply the demands of his province of
Maryland. Vermont and Connecticut established
mints in 1785 for the issue of copper
coin. New Jersey followed a year later. But
Congress had the establishment of a mint for
the confederated States under advisement, and
in this same year agreed upon a plan submitted
by Thomas Jefferson, and the act went
into operation on a small scale in 1787. After
the adoption of the Constitution of the United
States in 1789 all the State mints were closed,
as the Constitution specifically places the sole
power of coining money in the Federal Government.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">E. Wilson.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It is true that United States silver
dollars of certain issues command very high
premiums. The silver dollar of 1794, on which
the image of Liberty has flowing hair, is quoted
at $12.50; the “flying eagle dollars” of 1838 and
1839 are quoted at $15 each; so are the dollars
of 1851 and 1852 with “Liberty seated;” so is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
that of 1858, with the same figure; while the excessively
rare silver dollars of 1804 are quoted
at $200 each. The half-dollar of 1796, with a
filleted head and fifteen stars, commands $15;
and that of the next year, with
sixteen stars, commands $16. The
value depends entirely on the rarity of these
coins, since while the dollar of 1804 is quoted
at $200, the “spread-eagle dollar” of 1803 is
worth but $1.25. The fifteen and sixteen-star
dollars belong to the period when it was the law
that an additional stripe should be added to the
United States flag whenever a new State was
admitted. In the mintage they undertook to
add a star for each State, but the flag was restored
to the established rule of thirteen stripes,
and the Goddess of Liberty on the dollars was
relieved of the burden of carrying a star for each
new State.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Edward Coles, an early Governor of
Illinois, was born in Albemarle County, Va., the
home of Jefferson, in December, 1786. He in
his youth became prominent in our country’s
politics, and in 1810 was appointed private
secretary of President Madison. He served as
Minister to Russia in 1817, and, returning the
following year, liberated his slaves. From 1823
to 1826 he was Governor of Illinois, which position
he filled with considerable executive ability.
His death occurred in Philadelphia, July 7, 1868.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Jennie Smedley.</span><br>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The story is that one day Homer,
meeting a number of fishermen, asked them:
“Fishermen, sprung of Arcadia, have we aught?”
And they answered: “What we caught we left
behind. What we caught not we bear with us.”
Homer could not explain it. He then remembered
that the oracle had said “beware of riddles.”
In despair he wrote his own epitaph and
died within three days. This story comes from
a lost work of Aristotle, so it is said, but it is
decidedly fishy, and is classed with the numerous

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The total abstinence societies of to-day
are the outgrowth of the old temperate or
moderate drinking societies of England and
America. About 400 years ago an association
was formed, the members of which pledged
themselves not to drink more than a specified
quantity of alcoholic liquors each day. A society
somewhat similar was inaugurated in Germany
in 1600 called “The Order of Temperance,”
whose members were pledged never to become
intoxicated and to that end never to imbibe
more than fourteen cups of wine per day. In
America, also, there were moderate drinkers’ organizations.
In 1820 a society was formed in
New Jersey, the members of which agreed
never to drink more than one-half pint of
rum or whisky per day. The first total<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
abstinence movement of any importance
in this country began in Saratoga County,
New York, prompted by the Temperance
Society of Moreau and Northumberland.</p>

<p>Forty-three persons signed an agreement
not to drink “rum, gin, whisky, wine,
or any distilled spirits or compositions of the
same, or any of them, except by the advice of a
physician, or in case of actual disease, also excepting
wine at public dinners, under penalty
of 25 cents.” In 1813, The Massachusetts
Society for the Suppression of Intemperance
was formed, but owing to the laxity of its rules
it was not very efficient. The American Society
for the Promotion of Temperance was inaugurated
in Boston in February, 1826, and rapidly
grew into an extensive organization, having increased
in three years to 11 State associations
and 1,000 local societies. About this time the
name tee-total came into use, having originated
from the vain attempt of a stuttering
reformed Englishman to pronounce the
word “total.” In 1840 the Washingtonian
Society was formed by six drunkards in the city
of Baltimore, who resolved to avoid their cups
and reform their associates. In five years its
pledge had been signed by 650,000 persons,
most of whom had been tipplers or downright
drunkards. Other societies were soon formed;
the Sons of Temperance in New York, in 1842;
the Order of Templars of Honor and Temperance
in 1845; and the Good Templars in 1851.
Since the war many local societies have been
formed, and the Murphy movement has extended
all over the country.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The demand of the people living in
the outskirts of New York City for more rapid
transit than that furnished by the horse cars
began to be answered in 1868, when an elevated
railway extending a half-mile was constructed
on Greenwich street as an experiment. Three
years later the West Side Elevated Railroad
Company obtained a charter, but before much
could be accomplished it sold its rights to the
New York Elevated Railroad Company, in 1872.
The new organization proceeded rapidly to erect
its roads, extending from the heart of the city
to the suburbs. In December, 1879, its
rolling stock consisted of 131 locomotives, 292
passenger cars, and 8 service cars. The road
was leased to the Manhattan Railway Company
in May, 1879. The Metropolitan Elevated Railroad
was first called the Gilbert Elevated Railroad,
in honor of its projector, Dr. Rufus H. Gilbert.
Although the company obtained its charter
in 1872, work was not commenced until
March, 1876. In two years it expended $10.-300,000
in constructing its lines. In 1879 the
road with its rolling stock, consisting of fifty-six
locomotives, 180 passenger cars, and two
freight cars, was leased to the Manhattan Elevated
Railroad Company, which now has a complete
monopoly of the elevated railroads of New
York. The tracks of the Metropolitan are supported
on two rows of columns connected with
each other at the top by strong lattice-girders.
The rails weigh fifty-six pounds per yard, and
rest upon yellow-pine cross-ties, 6 x 7 inches by
8⅜ feet long, separated two feet apart. The engines
weigh fifteen tons, and are capable of a
speed of forty miles an hour. The stations are
about one-half mile apart. The New York Elevated
Railroad consists of a single row of columns,
supporting a lighter tramway than the
Metropolitan. Although at first this system of
railways met with considerable opposition, the
people of New York now recognize that its convenience
far outbalances its unsightliness, noise,
and other disagreeable concomitants.</p>

<p>Who was the author of Paul Pry and who was the

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Inquirer.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The author was John Poole, an English
dramatist, born in 1785. He was remarkably
successful in the production of light drama,
including some roaring farces, of which the
most conspicuous was “Paul Pry;” “Hamlet
Travestie,” with burlesque annotations; “Deaf
as a Post;” “Turning the Tables,” and “The
Wife’s Stratagem,” adapted from Shirley. It was
long believed that Thomas Hill, the eccentric
editor of the <cite>Dramatic Mirror</cite>, was the original
of Poole’s Paul Pry, but Poole himself contradicts
this notion in a biographical sketch of
himself that appeared a few years before his
death, which occurred in London, Feb. 5, 1872.
In this sketch he says: “The character of Paul
Pry was suggested by the following anecdote,
related to me several years ago by a beloved
friend: An idle old lady, living in a narrow
street, had passed so much of her time in
watching the affairs of her neighbors that
she at length knew the sound of each
particular knocker within hearing, and could
tell to which house it belonged. It happened
that she fell ill, and was for several days confined
to her bed. Unable to observe in person
what was going on outside, she stationed her
maid at the window as her substitute for the
performance of that task. But Betty soon grew
weary of the occupation; she became careless in
her reports, impatient and tetchy when reprimanded
for her negligence. ‘Betty, what are
you thinking about? Don’t you hear a double
knock at No. 9? Who is it?’ ‘The first floor
lodger, ma’am.’ ‘Betty! Betty! I declare I must
give you warning. Why don’t you tell me what
that knock is at No. 24?’ ‘Why, Lord, ma’am, it
is only the baker with pies.’ ‘<em>Pies!</em> Betty?
What <em>can</em> they want with pies at No. 24? They
had pies yesterday!’ Of this very point I have
availed myself. Let me add that Paul Pry was
never intended as the representative of any one
individual, but of a class. Like the melancholy
of Jacques, he ‘is compounded of many samples,’
and I could mention five or six who were unconscious
contributors to the character. That it
should have been so often, though erroneously,
supposed to have been drawn after some particular
person is perhaps complimentary to the
general truth of the delineation. With respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
to the play generally, I may say that it is original;
it is original in structure, plot, character,
and dialogue—such as they are. The only imitation
I am aware of is to be found in part of the
business in which Mrs. Subtle is engaged; while
writing those scenes I had strongly in my recollection
Collin d’Harleville’s ‘Vieux Celibataire.’
But even the little I have adopted is considerably
altered and modified by the necessity of
adapting it to the exigencies of a different plot.”</p>

<p>What is the condition of slavery in Cuba, and in
what time will emancipation be complete?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—According to a Cuban law, passed
by the Spanish Cortes in 1870, all persons who
should be born after June 23, 1870, and all who
should attain the age of 60, should be free after
June 23, 1870. This enactment, however, was
evaded to a considerable extent. The plantations
were supplied not only with negro but
also with Chinese coolies, who were subjected
to even greater servitude. In November,
1879, a new bill was passed by
the Spanish Cortes, which provided that
all slaves from 55 upward should become free;
that slaves from 50 to 55 should be liberated
Sept. 17, 1880; from 45 to 50, September, 1882;
from 40 to 45, in 1884; from 35 to 40, in 1886;
from 30 to 35, in 1888, and those under 30 in
1890. The bill also provided that the sum of
100,000 piastres should be set apart annually
for defraying the expenses of the emancipation,
the owner to receive 350 piastres for each slave.
This bill has gone into effect and is being generally
observed, although there is still some complaint
of its violation.</p>

and products of Washington Territory.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">W. Cleveland.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Cascade range of mountains extends
north and south through Washington
Territory, dividing it into two unequal parts,
which differ somewhat as to their climate and
soil. West of the mountains the climate is very
moderate. The inhabitants do not suffer either
from extreme heat or extreme cold, the annual
range of the thermometer being from zero to 85
degrees. The rainy season lasts three months
in winter, during which the inhabitants suffer
no great discomfort. The soil on the river bottoms
is a very rich alluvium. The uplands have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
a clay loam, but considerable tracts are sandy
soil. About Puget Sound forests of fir and cedar
extend up to the summits of the mountains,
while in the river bottoms may be found the
vine-maple, alder, and crab tree. Grain of all
kinds, nutritious grasses, hops, fruit, and vegetables
grow abundantly. East of the Cascades
the climate is a little drier, and the summer and
winter heat a little more extreme. The soil is
whiter than that of the Mississippi Valley, being
highly charged with alkaline deposits. Herding
now is the chief occupation of the settlers,
though it is expected that when the Northern
Pacific Railway is completed agriculture will become
more prominent. Fruitful orchards, surrounded
by fields of wheat, oats, barley, and rye
are not at all uncommon.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Between the Coast Ranges and the
Sierra Nevada lie the beautiful valleys of the
Sacramento and San Joaquin, named from the
rivers which drain them. The climate of the
country is very uniform, the mean summer temperature
of San Francisco, on the bay into which
these rivers empty, being 60 degrees, and that
of winter 51 degrees. The rainy season commences
in November and continues until
April, during which period, however, but
little inconvenience is occasioned. The dry
season is such that crops readily mature and
may be harvested, threshed, and sent
to market without being placed under
shelter. The soil is very productive, and, unless
the rain fails in its season, yields abundantly.
The grasses are numerous and nutritious.
Wheat, oats, corn, and other cereals
are grown quite extensively. But in many portions
of the valley the most lucrative business
is the cultivation of orchards and vineyards.
Grapes, apples, pears, plums, and in the southern
part apricots, oranges, and other tropical
fruits grow in abundance. On the verdant
slopes of the mountains sheep-grazing is carried
on on a large scale. Although these valleys
offer many inducements to settlers, land may
still be obtained in some places at moderate
prices.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Enos Thompson Throop, at one
time very prominent in politics, was born at
Johnstown, N. Y., Aug. 21, 1784. Choosing law
as his profession, he was admitted to the bar in
1806 and began practice at Auburn. He early
established an enviable reputation, and in 1814
was chosen to represent his district in Congress.
He was afterward appointed by Governor Yates
Circuit Judge of the Seventh District. In 1828
he was elected Lieutenant Governor, along with
Governor Van Buren, and when the latter accepted
a position in Jackson’s Cabinet he succeeded
him. In 1830 he was re-elected, but in
1832 declined a third term. He soon after removed
to Michigan, where he again became
prominent in political affairs. As age, however,
came upon him his health failed and he returned
again to his native State. He died in his

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">H. M. Valentine.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Four correct “noon-marks” are
made in a year, on the following days: Dec. 24,
April 15, June 14, and Sept. 1. Owing to the inclination
of the earth’s axis and its unequal
movement in its orbit, solar days vary in their
length. The average solar day corresponds to
the twenty-four hours of our clocks, which
keep what is called mean time. If a clock were
so constructed as to give the real solar time for
all periods of the year, it would be observed that
sometimes when the solar clock pointed at noon,
the ordinary clock, keeping mean time, would be
pointing at figures between 11:45 and 12, or at
other times between 12 and 12:15. Four times
each year, however, upon the days mentioned,
the two clocks would coincide, and the shadow
of a dial, or noon-mark, would point due south
at noon by the clock.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Henry Bergh, the philanthropist,
was born in New York, in 1823. He received his
education at Columbia College, where he manifested
a considerable love for literature. He
afterward obtained some notoriety as an author
by writing a drama entitled “Love’s Attractions,”
a poem entitled “Married Off,” and several tales
and sketches. In 1863 he was made Secretary of
the United States Legation to Russia, and subsequently
Vice Consul. Returning to this country,
he founded the American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, which was
incorporated in 1866. This association
has grown into considerable magnitude,
having branches in most of the
States and receiving the support of the best citizens.
The society endeavors to prevent cruelty
to all kinds of animals by securing the passage
and enforcement of laws to accomplish that object.
It also takes into consideration things
which pertain to the health of the people, such
as purity of meat, milk, etc. As a minor illustration
of its good work, a few years ago sportsmen
were accustomed to shoot pigeons at shooting
matches; but by an effort of the Humane
Society glass balls have been substituted. Mr.
Bergh continues to preside over the association.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—In the year 1835 Michigan adopted
a State constitution and chose Stevens T. Mason,
the Territorial Governor, as its first State Governor.
It then demanded of Congress a recognition
as a State and the rights of representation. This
request Congress agreed to grant, providing the
petitioning State would accept the boundary
line claimed by Ohio. Not until January, 1837,
would Michigan accept such terms, and then
only on condition that it should receive, in lieu
of the disputed strip on the south, the territory
on Lake Superior now known as the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan. Immediately after this
the State was formally admitted. By special
permission the State was allowed to cast three
electoral votes in the Presidential contest of
1836-7. In the same year in which it was admitted,
Mr. Mason was re-elected to the position
of Governor, which office he continued to hold
until 1839.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Bolivar y Ponte, surnamed The Liberator,
was a South American patriot, who in
July, 1783, was born in Caracas, a town in the
then Spanish province of Venezuela. His father,
having obtained considerable wealth, like many
of the early adventurers, sent his son
to Madrid to pursue the study
of law. When Venezuela in 1810 endeavored to
throw off the yoke of Spanish oppression,
Bolivar joined the cause of the patriots and began
service under Miranda. Soon his own ability
eclipsed that of his senior officer and he was
given a separate command. Defeating the Spaniards
in August, 1813, he entered Caracas at the
head of his victorious army in triumph. He was
immediately appointed dictator; but his enjoyment
of that office was suddenly terminated by
the reappearance of the Spaniards, who in 1814
defeated and drove him from the province. His
defeat, however, did not discourage him. In
1817 he led the patriots in a battle against
Morillo and again found himself a conqueror.
Venezuela chose him to be her President, and in
1819 New Granada did him like honor, the two
States uniting to form Colombia. In 1823<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
his love for liberty and hatred of
Spain caused him to lend assistance
to the revolting Peruvians. The latter
were successful, and as a reward for the excellent
service of the Liberator, Bolivia, named in his
honor, was erected into a separate State, and
Bolivar was made its President for life. For a
few years he remained President of both Colombia
and Bolivia. He died in December, 1830.</p>

<p>What part did France take in placing Maximilian on
the throne of Mexico?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">M. M. Aldil.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Taking advantage of the war which
occupied the attention of the United States, Napoleon
III., planned the conquest of Mexico.
With but little difficulty his army succeeded in
this enterprise and occupied the City of Mexico
in 1863. He soon discovered the barren nature
of his conquest and the certainty of final failure.
To rid himself of the consequences of
what had proved a most costly enterprise, before
he should be forced to a humiliating abandonment
of the country, he tempted Maximilian,
Archduke of Austria, to accent the
crown of Mexico. To give eclat to
the affair and the color of popular
approval, he ordered an election. This was
dominated by French troops and Napoleon’s
Mexican accomplices, and the result was an apparent
popular vote to adopt an imperial form
of government and invite Maximilian to accept
the throne. In 1864 he was received with festivities
and other marks of distinction planned
by the French and their Mexican supporters.
The Mexican patriots, however, still maintained
an organization. When driven out of the capital
President Juarez retired to San Luis Potosi, then
to Monterey, and finally to Chihuahua, and with
his Cabinet still maintained the form of a central,
national head of the republic. The French
availed of the excuse that Maximilian was in
possession of the government to return
to France, and leave him to his own
resources. The guerrilla bands of patriots which
had kept up the harassment of the imperial
troops with more or less persistency from the
first, gathered strength, and at last, deserted by
Napoleon, attacked on all sides by the rallying
militia of the republic, the unhappy Emperor
undertook to escape from the country, was captured,
and finally executed at Queretaro, June
19, 1867. The French were wholly responsible
for placing Maximilian in Mexico and for abandoning
him to his unhappy fate.</p>

<p>Please give us information as to the origin, object,
and extent of trades unions.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">W. A. Lewis.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The various trade societies are the
outgrowth of the old English guilds, which originated
in the beginning of the eleventh century,
and had for their prime object the relief or support
of infirm guild-brothers, the burial of the
dead with proper religious services, etc. In
time, however, these organizations became better
classified and more exclusive. One guild was
confined to the merchants, another to the woolen
manufacturers, another to the cutlery manufacturers,
etc.: the objects, at the same time, becoming
more comprehensive. In order to secure
skilled workmen and prevent competition with
the inexperienced, the craftsmen secured the
passage of apprenticeship laws. In the case of
woolen and several other trades apprentices
were required to serve manufacturers seven years.
Employers and employes were then united in
these efforts, but, finally, as the manufacturing
industries became more profitable and improved,
and machinery was introduced, the rich
masters withdrew from the craftguilds, and began
to hire children and men who had not served a
complete apprenticeship. This action on the
part of the employers caused the first “trade
society” to be formed, in 1796, called the Institution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
which had for its object the protection
of its members against the encroachments
of capitalists, and to secure the passage of
stricter apprenticeship laws. Since that time
the trades unions have increased in number and
membership, until they include nearly all the
craftsmen of England, and from protective
associations they have grown into societies for
the general improvement of the laboring classes.
To its efforts mainly are due the passage of the
eight-hour law of Great Britain and the statute
granting the Saturday half-holiday. In the
United States similar organizations are found,
to which, especially in large cities, nearly all the
workmen belong.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The drowning of Pharaoh and his
host in the Red Sea had nothing to do with its
name. It takes this from a peculiar reddish
color remarked at certain seasons of the year
in parts of this sea, due to marine plants, or to
reddish animalculæ, called by sailors “whale
feed,” which float on it like a scum; or to the
reefs of red coral which abound in many parts
of it; or, possibly, to the fact that its upper
coast was one of the boundaries of Edom, “the
red.” No Biblical scholar of any repute has
ever asserted that the sea took its name from
the overthrow of Pharaoh.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Fort Dodge</span>, Iowa.<br>
</p>

<p>The farmers of this section of the country need to
know what a good creamery is. Tell us what the
inside of a really good creamery looks like.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Many Readers.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—A Chicago inquirer says: “Oblige
butter and cheese consumers with a description
of a first-class creamery. Some of us have a
very vague notion of such an establishment.—E.
D. Smith.” Another inquiry comes from Neligh,
Neb. So some care has been taken to obtain a
description of a thoroughly well-constructed
factory of this kind. This is the more important
as the dairy business of the West is growing
with wonderful rapidity, and nothing has done
more to develop this industry than the recent
introduction of creameries. The term creamery
was formerly applied to an establishment fitted
up expressly for the purpose of manufacturing
butter, but now the name is given to factories
where both butter and cheese are made. Milk
is brought in spring wagons from dairy-farms
for a distance of six miles or less, and cream is
gathered anywhere within a radius of fifteen
miles to be manufactured into butter and
cheese. This product thus handled in larger
quantities, in a scientific manner, with effective
labor-saving machinery and proper surroundings,
makes it possible to obtain the best results,
and such product is always marketable at
prices much higher than dairy butter.
The factory of the Aurora Creamery Company,
built at Aurora, Ill., about a year ago is generally
regarded as a model establishment, and
will furnish an example for this description.
To operate a creamery successfully two things
are absolutely necessary, viz., a good spring of
living water of low temperature, say 50 to 54 deg.,
and good drainage; without these features there
is no prospect of permanent success in the undertaking.
The factory named has a spring
located about 200 feet off which discharges,
both winter and summer, 750 gallons of pure
water per hour, temperature 52 deg., with 5 feet 9
inches fall, while drainage is supplied by a 2-foot
square stone sewer which empties into the river,
through which a slough is drained, and into
which there is a 5-foot fall from the factory.
The main building is of brick with a 12-inch
wall: size, 32 × 70, 20 feet high; right wing,
20 × 24; left wing, 18 × 24, and rear extension,
18 × 26. The room in which the cheese is manufactured
is 30 × 40. It contains a fine upright
9-horse-power engine, a Wir’s self-agitating
rotary cheese vat with a capacity for 12,000
pounds of milk and a gang cheese press. The
butter room, 30 × 30 feet, contains one churn
with a capacity of 400 gallons, and one with a
capacity of 150 gallons, a power butter worker,
sink with steam pipes to scald, and revolving
brush for washing cans, 3 cream vats
300 gallons each, a receiving vat
into which the milk is strained,
and from which it is drawn into deep pails, or
sets, which are placed in three cemented water
vats of capacity sufficient to cool 20,000 pounds
of milk daily. The left wing of the factory contains
a 16-horse power boiler, which furnishes
steam to run the machinery and heat the building;
a seventy-barrel water tank, which is
placed over the boiler; a Davidson steam pump
and coal bin which will store fifty tons of coal.
An improvement which, it is claimed, is found
in no other factory, is an elevated “whey vat”
placed over the boiler-room, into which the
whey is raised by a rotary pump, and from
which the farmers draw their supply of whey to
be carried into the country. When all that is
wanted has been drawn out a gate is opened,
and the balance is run into the river, after
which the tank is scalded out and kept sweet
and clean. This is a vast improvement over the
pestilence breeding arrangement which is sunk
in the ground, and is located near the butter
and cheese rooms of most other factories. The
right wing of the factory contains a driveway, a
receiving-room, weighing platform, and stairway
to office. The extension holds 150 tons of
ice, and contains a refrigerator with a capacity
of 30,000 pounds of butter. In the second story
is a neat office, store-rooms, and
curing room, to which the cheese are raised by
an elevator. The lower floors are made of 2 × 6
joists, dressed and matched and imbedded in
cement; under which is a four-inch coating of
grout, so that there is no possible chance for the
milk to leak through the floor and produce the
sickening stench which is so common in many
factories. Special attention has been given to
ventilation in every part of the building and
the whole establishment has the appearance in
neatness of a tidy farmhouse kitchen. The sum
of $10,000 was expended in real estate, buildings,
and fixtures of this factory, but a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
creamery with a comfortable outfit of medium
capacity could be put up for much less money.
The machinery for churning and working the
butter is as simple as it is ingenious. The churn
is a great square chest revolving on an axis running
through its longest diameter; the butter-workers
are fluted wooden cones running around
a circular disk inclined at an angle to the
horizon, so that the buttermilk runs off as fast
as it is expressed. The apparatus for stirring
the cheese curd and pressing the cheese, and a
score of other nicely contrived instruments,
operate with the uniformity and precision of
clock work.</p>

<p>How does the speed of railroad trains in this country
compare with that of trains in Europe?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">C. D. Adams.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The fastest recorded railroad speed
in the United States is given in the New York
Clipper Almanac, as follows: The train which
left West Philadelphia for Jersey City over the
Pennsylvania Railroad at 7:35 a. m., Sept. 4,
1879 (Edward Osborn, engineer), made 1 mile in
50¼ seconds; 3 miles in 2 m. 36¼ sec., and 5
miles in 4 m. 50 sec. A train on the Lake Shore
and Michigan Southern Railroad made the run
from Hamburg to Buffalo, N. Y., 10 miles, in 8
minutes. The locomotive Hamilton Davis and
six cars, on the New York Central Railroad in
1855, made 14 miles in 11 minutes. A new
Fontaine engine and two coaches, carrying W.
H. Vanderbilt and party, ran from Amherstburg
to St. Thomas, Can., over the Canada Southern
Railroad, 111 miles, in 98 minutes—no stop.
Probably the fastest run ever made for any considerable
distance in England was that of the
special train carrying the Duke of Wellington
from Paddington to Slough, 18 miles, in 15
minutes. But these are exceptional runs; what
is of more importance is to compare regular
time-table speed. The London <cite>Engineer</cite> says,
commenting on a series of articles on this subject
which have appeared in the German journal,
<cite>Die Verkehrszeitung</cite>, in the <cite>American Railroad
Gazette</cite>, and in other papers, “it appears
that railroad speeds in Great Britain, on the
Continent, and in the United States are much
slower than most people suppose. If we take
for instance, the run from London to Edinburgh,
a distance of 397 miles via York, this is made in
9 hours by great Northern trains, the average
speed being 44.1 miles per hour. From Euston
the distance is 401 miles, and London and
Northwestern trains make the run in 10 hours,
or 40.1 miles an hour. By the Midland Railway
the distance is 404 miles, and the time 10 h. 5
min., or very nearly the same speed. Some of
the fastest trains in the world are those run between
Leeds and London. From King’s Cross
the distance by the Great Northern is 186½
miles. From St. Pancras by the Midland is 196
miles. The fastest train on the Great Northern
makes the run in 4 h. 5 min., or an average
speed of 45.4 miles an hour. The Midland trains
traverse the distance in 4 h. 30 min., giving an
average velocity of 43.5 miles an hour. The
fastest train in the world is the Flying
Dutchman, broad gauge, which makes
the run to Swindon at 53½ miles an hour. The
Great Northern trains run from London to York,
188 miles, at 48 miles an hour, and at least one
train runs to Peterborough at 51 miles an hour.
The run from London to Grantham has been
made repeatedly at 51 miles an hour. On the
United States railways the quickest run appears
to be that made between Jersey City and Philadelphia,
89 miles, made at the rate of 47⅔ miles
an hour. There is not in the world a train timed
to run 60 miles an hour, although it is, of
course, certain that that velocity is often exceeded.
If a speed of 60 miles an hour could be
maintained continually between London and
Edinburgh, the journey would occupy only 6
hours and 36 minutes; and allowing for three
stops of 10 minutes each on the route, the time
would be under 7¼ hours, instead of 10 hours.
So far as the machinery of a railway is concerned—by
which we mean the road, the rolling
stock, and the signals—there is nothing to prevent
an average speed of 60 miles an hour being
maintained. That it is not attained is certain.”</p>

his wife, which culminated in his charging her
with adultery and suing for divorce. This
charge, however, was neither proven nor generally

<p>What flag, if any, did the provincials use in the battle
of Bunker Hill, June 17, 1775? What was the first
flag used by the revolutionary army?</p>

<p class="right">
H. J. H.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Reference to that standard work,
“The Origin and Progress of the Flag of the
United States of America,” by George Henry
Preble, U. S. N., and other sources of information,
shows that it is uncertain what flag, if any,
was displayed by the Americans at Bunker Hill,
in the famous fight of June 17, 1775. The flag
raised on Prospect Hill by General Putnam, a
month later, July 18, 1775, was red, with the
motto, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui Transtulit Sustinet</i>
, (who transplanted
still sustains) on one side, and “An
Appeal to Heaven” on the other. This latter
motto was emblazoned on the white flag with a
green pine tree carried by the privateers commissioned
by Massachusetts, soon after this.
The first cruisers commissioned by Washington
also bore “the pine tree flag.” Before the battle
of Bunker Hill, indeed, immediately after the
battle of Lexington, on the 19th of the preceding
April, the provincial troops of Connecticut
carried a standard bearing the arms of that colony
and the Latin motto above cited. As General
Putnam and his Connecticut troops took a
prominent part in the battle of Bunker Hill, it is
presumable that this flag was displayed in that
action, and by parity of reasoning it may be inferred
that the colonial flags of Massachusetts
and New Hampshire were carried into the action
by the militia of those colonies. Precisely what
these were it is almost or quite impossible to determine
with certainty. Indeed, there seem to
have been several different flags. The “union-flags”
so frequently mentioned in the accounts
left us of the revolutionary movements of
1774 and the early part of 1775 were,
in most instances, the English red ensign, with
such mottoes as “Liberty and Union,” “Liberty
and Property,” or simply “Liberty.” Peculiar
devices were employed by the patriots of different
neighborhoods. Not until Jan. 2, 1776, was
the first common standard raised. This was the
“Great Union,” as it was christened, adopted by
General Washington, and first displayed at his
headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., on the date
above given. It consisted of thirteen stripes,
alternately white and red, with the crosses of
St. George and St. Andrew in the union where
the stars now glitter.</p>

<p>Can Our Curiosity Shop tell us why steaks cut from
the small end of the sirloin are called porterhouse
steaks?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Epicure.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Colonel Thomas F. De Voe, a New
York butcher, author of “The Market Book,”
“The Market Assistant,” and other works of
similar nature, gives the following account of
this now popular cut of beef: Martin Morrison
kept a favorite porterhouse at No. 327 Pearl
street, New York, near the old Walton House. It
was a popular resort with many of the New
York pilots, because here they were always sure
of a pot of ale or porter and “a hot bite,” including
one or two substantial dishes. On one
occasion, in 1814, Morrison had enjoyed an unusual
number of calls for steaks, and when an
old pilot, who dropped in at a late hour, called
for something substantial to eat, he was
forced to cut from a sirloin roasting piece
which he had got for the next day’s
family dinner. The old pilot relished his steak
amazingly and called for another. This disposed
of, “he squared himself in front of his host and
vociferated, ‘Look ye here, messmate, arter this
I want my steaks off the roasting piece! Do you
hear that? So mind your weather eye, old boy!’”
The old pilot’s companions soon learned to appreciate
these cuts, and it was not long before
they were all insisting on having them. Accordingly,
Morrison’s butcher, Thomas Gibbons,
of the Fly Market, asked him why he had ceased
to order the large sirloin steaks. Morrison explained
that he had found that cuts from the
small end of the sirloin of the beef suited his
single customers best, both in size and quality,
and directed that thereafter, instead of sending
him the sirloin roasts uncut, he have them cut
into chops or steaks, as he should direct. Gibbons’
daily order, “Cut steaks for the porterhouse,”
soon gave these the name of “porterhouse
steaks,” by which they became known all
through the Fly Market, particularly as this excellent
cut rapidly became popular in all the
public houses of the city. The name is now
familiar to housekeepers on both sides of the
Atlantic, at least wherever the English language
is spoken.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, D. C., Feb. 14, 1883.—A. H.
Field, Esq., Indian River, Mich.—Sir: I am in
receipt of your letter of the 31st ult., in which
you state that you served four years in the army
during the late civil war, and that in 1878 you
made a homestead entry of eighty acres—all
that you could get in that locality—and have
lived on the same ever since, and made final
proof. You ask if you are not entitled to an additional
entry of eighty acres. In reply, I
have to state that <em>you are not</em>. The homestead
act of June 8, 1872, provides that any soldier
who served for ninety days in the army during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
the war of the rebellion, and was honorably
discharged, who may have <em>heretofore</em> entered
under the homestead laws a less quantity than
160 acres, shall be permitted to enter a sufficient
quantity of land, which, added to that embraced
in the original entry, shall not exceed 160 acres.
Such provision was carried into the Revised
Statutes of the United States (Sec. 2306), which
statutes were approved June 22, 1874, and since
that date if such a soldier elects to enter a less
amount of land than 160 acres, he must abide by
his election. Very respectfully,</p>

<p>Mr. Field writes to <span class="smcap">The Inter Ocean</span>, inclosing
this letter from the Commissioner of the
General Land Office, and complaining that this
law inflicts a hardship on him and other soldiers
in the late war, who, like himself, deferred their
entries until after the passage of the above act.
He says: “It seems that it is unfortunate for
me, as an old soldier, that I did not locate my
land previous to June, 1874. I ought to be entitled
to eighty acres of land more as well as any
other class of soldiers.” Whether this complaint
is or is not well founded, the fact remains that
the law is as above stated.</p>

<p>By what method do sailors at sea determine their

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Dobs.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The mariner determines his latitude
by observing the meridian altitude
of a celestial star whose declination
or distance from the equator is
known. In the northern hemisphere for an approximate
answer the pole star is generally
taken, the altitude of which is nearly the latitude
of the place. If an observer were standing
upon the equator and looking to the north he
would see the pole star on the horizon, with no
altitude. If he should move three degrees north
the pole star would have an altitude corresponding.
At Chicago it is above the horizon
about 41 degrees 50 minutes, corresponding to
the latitude of this city. Owing to the apparent
revolution of the pole star about a central axis,
which is the true pole of the heavens, the accurate
latitude can only be obtained by
observing its least and greatest altitude
and taking one-half their sum. The
longitude of any place computed from Greenwich,
Washington, or other prime meridian, is
easily determined by observing the Greenwich
or Washington time when the sun passes the
zenith meridian. In other words, knowing the
difference in time between Greenwich and the
place of observation, the longitude of the place
may be readily computed. A difference of time
amounting to one hour represents 15 degrees of
longitude east or west, as the case may be. The
difference in time between Chicago and Washington
is forty-three minutes, which makes the
longitude of Chicago 10 degrees 45 minutes,
reckoning from the legal prime meridian of the
United States, which is that of Washington.
Every ship carries a marine chronometer, which
is a time-keeper of the most careful construction,
whose accuracy has been tested with the
utmost precision—which is plainly a matter of
the utmost importance to a vessel when it is remembered
that an error of four seconds of time
represents about one and one-tenth statute
miles, enough to wreck a ship on a lee shore
when the captain, following the chronometer,
supposed himself at a safe distance from the
shoal or shore.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, N. Y.<br>
</p>

<p>Who first devised the signs of the zodiac, and for
what purpose?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Chas. W. Smith.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Representations of the zodiacal
signs are found among the ancient writings of
the Hindoos, Persians, and Chinese, and among
the carvings on the ruins of Egyptian temples.
There is such a degree of similarity in the characters
that a common origin must be supposed.
The signs of the zodiac embrace the twelve important
constellations, which, owing to the motions
of the earth, appear to revolve through the
heavens within a belt extending nine degrees
on each side of the sun’s apparent annual path,
and within or near which all the planets revolve.
Since the sun appears successively in each of
these twelve constellations during the year, the
zodiac was divided into twelve equal parts, corresponding
to the months. These signs and
their subdivisions were used in measuring time
and as the basis of astronomical and astrological
calculations and predictions. Astronomers
now, for convenience, use the same signs,
giving to each constellation an extent of thirty
degrees, although the constellations vary in
size. These signs are Aries representing the ram;
Taurus, the bull; Gemini, the twins; Cancer,
the crab; Leo, the lion; Virgo, the virgin;
Libra, the balance; Scorpio, the scorpion;
Sagittarius, the archer; Capricornus, the goat;
Aquarius, the water-bearer; and Pisces, the
fishes. On the 20th of March the sun enters
Aries, and at midnight Virgo, the opposite constellation,
will be overhead. During the month
of April the sun will pass into Taurus, and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
midnight Libra will be overhead. The early
astronomers were astrologers, and claimed
to be able to predict the future
careers of individuals and nations by
observing the positions and movements of the
planets, and condition of the weather, at the
most important periods of men’s lives. A man
born when the sun was in the constellation Scorpio
was believed to be naturally bent toward
excessive indulgence of the animal passions;
one born when the sun was in Aries was destined
to be a great scholar or ruler; one born when
the sun was in Pisces was predestined to
grovel or be a servant, and so on. All this is regarded
now as exploded superstition, except
by fortune-tellers and their dupes.</p>

<p>Will Our Curiosity Shop tell us what relation the
Prince Jerome Bonaparte, lately arrested in France
for issuing an insurrectionary proclamation, bears to
Napoleon I. and oblige many readers?</p>

<p class="right">
T.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Jerome Bonaparte, the father of this
Prince Jerome, was the youngest brother of
Napoleon I. In 1803, when he was only 18
years of age, he married Miss Elizabeth Patterson,
of Baltimore. This act was displeasing to
Napoleon, who passed a decree annulling the
marriage on the ground that his brother was not
of age and the bans were not published in
France. Soon after the return of Jerome to his
native country he was made King of Westphalia,
and at the suggestion of Napoleon, married Catherine,
daughter of the King of Wurtemburg. Of
this marriage three children were born—Jerome
Napoleon, in 1814, who died in 1847; Napoleon
Joseph Charles Paul, the subject of
this sketch, in 1822, who afterward
took his elder brother’s name, and
the Princess Mathilde. The Prince first came
into prominence by his denunciation of the
government of Louis Philippe and his sympathy
with the revolutionists, which caused his banishment
in 1845. But, in 1848, he returned and
participated in the revolution. In 1852 he took
his seat in the Senate and Council of State, receiving
the title of Prince and being declared by
decree of the Senate the heir of his cousin, Napoleon
III., in case the latter should die without
issue. He took part in the Crimean war, commanding
a reserve force at Alma and at Inkerman.
Before the close of the war he was recalled,
ostensibly on account of his health, and
soon entered upon the duties of several important
civil offices. In 1859 he was married
to Princess Clothilde, daughter of the
late Victor Emanuel, King of Italy, by whom he
has three children. In 1861 he visited the
United States, and, with his suite and the French
Minister, accompanied the Army of the Potomac,
pushing as far South as Richmond. After his
return he sympathized to a certain extent with
the democratic feeling arising in France. For
this seeming absurdity he was given the name
Plon-Plon. In 1876 he was returned to the
French Assembly from Corsica, but in the year
following he was rejected. On the death of the
Prince Imperial, as the son of Napoleon III. is
called, in Zululand, in 1879, Jerome became the
head of the Bonaparte family. He was not popular
with a majority of the leading Bonapartists,
many of whom refused to acknowledge
him as their chief, and urged
the proclamation of the elder of Jerome’s two
sons as the heir of Napoleon III. Of late, however,
there has been a reconciliation between
the ex-Empress Eugenie and Jerome, and the
Bonapartists generally seem disposed to acquiesce;
so that, in case of the Bonaparte’s coming
to the front once more, his title of Prince
may become something more than an empty
sound.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—This county lies on the northern

the land is very rich and yields abundantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
wheat, corn, and other cereals. In 1879 the corn
crop of Cedar County amounted to 2,826,259
bushels, or 40 bushels per acre, which was the
largest yield of any county in the State.
Orchards of choice fruit trees have been set out
and thrive well. The climate is like that of
Southern Dakota and Northwestern Iowa, very
warm in summer and cold in winter, which latter,
from the dryness of the climate, is rendered
more endurable than a higher temperature in
some of the more Eastern States. The population
in 1880 was 2,899. St. Helena, the county

<p>In Our Curiosity Shop of Jan. 11, C. A. Sharp
asks for the location of the Garden of Eden. The
Bible tells us that “a river went out of Eden to
water the garden, and from thence it was parted
and became into four heads.” It then proceeds
to give them in the order of distance above the
mouth of the Euphrates. But one of these
rivers is now known by its original name, and
that is the Euphrates. Let us, therefore, go
down that and see if we can find the other three
tributary to it that will agree with the narrative.
The first is a large stream from the north. We
at once recognize it as the Hiddekel. This is the
third river, and its head is far to the north, as is
also that of the Euphrates. The text says, “it
goeth toward the east of Assyria.” The marginal
reading, I think, will be found to explain
this. It says “it goeth east to Assyria,” and the
great Assyrian Empire was upon it. As we go
down these united rivers we find a considerable
stream from the northeast, the head of which is
in the mountains toward the Caspian Sea. If
this is the second river, the Gihon, the text says
it “compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.”
This expression has doubtless led to much confusion,
as the mind has been turned to Ethiopia,
in Africa, and which seemed irreconcilable with
the text. But turn to the passage and we find the
marginal reading to be Cush, and Cush, or
Cutha, was a country east of the Hiddekel,
through which this stream flows. We turn again
to the narrative and it says the first river is the
Pison, and that it compasseth the land of Havilah,
where there is gold and precious stones.
After leaving the mouth of the second river, the
Gihon, we find a stream having its head in the
mountains east of the Persian Gulf, and also a
place called Havilah. The country abounds in
precious stones and valuable minerals, and this,
with the other three rivers, seems to fill the conditions
of the text. We will now hastily review
the above to see more clearly its coincidence with
the account as given by Moses 2,500 years afterward,
in the second chapter of Genesis. A river
went out of Eden to water the garden, and from
thence it was parted into four heads. The name
of the first is Pison, etc.; this we find in
the stream coming from Persia, which fulfills its
conditions. The second is the Gihon; it too
coming from the land of Cush agrees with the
text. The third, the Hiddekel, all admit to be
the modern Tigris and its connections with
Assyria agree well with the record. The fourth
is the Euphrates, which flows as of old. But was
there a place called Eden from which these
streams flowed? Turn to Isa. xxxvii., 12, in the
blasphemous letter sent to King Hezekiah by the
commander of the Assyrian army, and among
the nations he has destroyed is Eden, which from
its connections with the other nations is supposed
to have been near the junction of the third
and fourth rivers. And in the list of nations
trading with Tyre we find Eden connected with
the nations in the same vicinity. See Ezekiel
xxiii., 23. Here then, at no great distance above the
Persian Gulf, near 30 degrees north latitude, in
a mild climate on a noble river, we may look for
the home of the progenitors of our race.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Thomas Wolsey, the wily, skillful
statesman and ambitious Cardinal, whose life
was so intimately associated with that of the
profligate king, Henry VIII., studied theology
at Oxford, and in 1500, at the age of 29, took
holy orders and became the rector at Lymington.
He was introduced into the royal court of
Henry VII. as chaplain, in which office he obtained
the confidence of the king, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
often consulted in important state affairs. His
successful diplomacy at the court of the Emperor
Maximilian secured for him, as a reward,
the deanery of Lincoln. When Henry VIII.
ascended the throne he employed Wolsey as his
almoner. With the talents of a skillful diplomat,
the ambitious priest obtained an influence
over this monarch even greater than he had previously
held over his royal father. In 1514 he
was appointed Archbishop of York, and in the
following year became Lord Chancellor of England.
The Pope was not unmindful of his able
supporter, who in the same year that he
became Chancellor was clothed in the
resplendent robes of a cardinal.
Four years after he became legate.
In the height of his power he was the virtual
sovereign of the kingdom, and in addition he
exercised throughout England and its dependencies,
and to some extent beyond these boundaries,
nearly all the prerogatives of the sovereign
pontiff. His income was scarcely surpassed by
that of the king himself. Princes and even monarchs
were among the suppliants for his favor
and influential offices. He aspired to sit on the
papal throne, and twice it seemed as if he would
realize this aspiration, but he was defeated
through the intrigues and power of Charles V.,
whose elevation to the imperial throne, left vacant
by the death of the Emperor Maximilian,
he had opposed in behalf of Henry VIII. His
almost regal power continued until Henry desired
to put away his wife, Catharine, aunt of
Charles V., when Wolsey’s dilatoriness in securing
the divorce exasperated the king, and
upon his refusing to sanction Henry’s marriage
with Anne Boleyn, he was soon dismissed in disgrace.
He was stripped of all his honors and
estates, but was suffered to retain his episcopal
see of Winchester until the following year,
1530, when a conspiracy against the king’s life
having been discovered, Wolsey was arrested
us an abettor. He was on his way to London to
undergo trial on a charge of treason, when he
fell ill and died Nov. 29, 1530, at the Monastery
of Leicester. Among his last words were the
following addressed to the Lord Lieutenant of
the Tower: “Master Kyngston, if I had served
my God as diligently as I have done the king, He
would not have given me over in my gray hairs.”
As paraphrased by Shakespeare, these last words
of the fallen Cardinal are now immortal.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Rock Island</span>, Ill.<br>
</p>

<p>How does Alaska compare in size with New York
State or Illinois; and what are its principal natural
characteristics?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A. N. Brown.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Alaska, according to the report of
Ivan Petroff, special agent of the census of 1880,
contains 531,400 square miles. This is as large
as all New England, together with New York,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and the
following seven grand States west of the Alleghanies:
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan,
Wisconsin, Kentucky, and Tennessee. It is a
vast region, 2,200 miles in length from east to
west (measuring to the farthest of the Aleutian
Islands), and 1,400 miles broad. It has a remarkable
coast line of 25,000 miles in extent,
which is about two and a half times as much as
the sea coast of all the rest of the United States.
The islands of Alaska alone, according to the
estimate quoted by Dr. Jackson, comprise an
area of over 31,000 miles, or twice as much as
the total area of Maine. The highest mountains
in the United States are in Alaska: Mount Fairweather,
15,500; Mount Crillon, 15,900: Mount
Cook, 16,000, and Mount St. Elias,
19,500. It is remarkable for the number
and stupendous proportions of its
glaciers. Says Dr. Jackson: “From Bute Inlet
to Unimak Pass nearly every gulch has its glacier,
some of which are vastly greater and
grander than any glacier in the Alps.” Hot and
mineral springs abound. The Yukon River is
one of the largest in the United States, being for
the first 1,000 miles from one to five miles wide
with five mouths, forming a delta seventy miles
across. According to Mr. Robert Campbell, of
the Hudson’s Bay Fur Company, including its
chief tributary, the Pelly, it is navigable at certain
seasons for nearly 3,000 miles.</p>

<p>Nearly all the sealskins used in the markets of
the world come from two little islands belonging
to Alaska. The skins of the sea otter are also
very valuable, and there are many choice land
fur-bearing animals. The waters are wonderfully
rich in fish. Besides cod, “Alaska can
supply the world,” says Dr. Jackson, “with salmon,
herring, and halibut of the best quality.”
It is also “the great reserve lumber region of
the United States.” There are “thousands of
square miles of yellow cedar, white spruce, hemlock,
and balsam fir that densely cover the southeastern
section of Alaska.” Gold and silver
mines of considerable importance have been
opened, and there are indications that the Territory
is rich not only in the precious metals, but
in other minerals, especially in iron, copper, and
coal. In the interior the climate along the
Yukon is not unlike that of Dakota. At
Fort Yukon the thermometer often rises above
100 degrees in summer, and indicates from 50
degrees to 70 degrees below zero in winter.
Along the immense southern coast and islands
the climate is moist and warm. At Sitka, according
to records kept for forty-five years, the
mean spring temperature is 41.2 degrees; summer,
54.6 degrees; autumn, 44.9 degrees; winter,
32.5 degrees; for the whole year, 43.3 degrees.
“The surprising fact is brought to light,” adds
Dr. Jackson, who takes the above figures from
the Alaska Coast Pilot, “that the winter climate
of Southern Alaska for forty-five years past has
been the average winter climate of Kentucky
and West Virginia, and the average summer
climate of Minnesota.” The mild climate of this
region is due to the warm Japan current of the
Pacific, the Kuro-Siwo. Generally of Alaska,
Mr. William H. Dale, of the Smithsonian Institution,
says: “I come back convinced, from
personal inspection, that Alaska is a far better
country than much of Great Britain and Norway,
and even part of Prussia.” The total population
in 1880 is given at 33,426, of whom 430
were white, 1,756 Creole or mixed races, and the
rest Indians—Innuits, 17,617; Aleuts, 2,145;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Thlinkets, 6,763; Hyda, 788, distributed as follows:
The whites and creoles are nearly all in
Southeastern Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, and
Kadiak, which is the division including the south
coast of the Alaska Peninsula down to Zakharof
Bay, with the adjacent islands, the Kadiah
group, the coast and islands of Cook’s Inlet, the
Kenai Peninsula, the coast of Prince William’s
Sound, and valleys of rivers running into the
waters of these coasts. Since the census was
taken the white population has been greatly increased
by the influx of gold miners and speculators.
This Territory is still without a regularly
constituted civil government. The laws of
the United States “relating to customs, lumber,
and navigation” are extended over it, and the
Collector and Deputy Collectors have authority
to arrest persons violating these laws and send
them to Oregon or California to be tried in
United States courts. Otherwise the government
is mainly a provisional one, organized by
the people and enforced by general consent. It
is high time that this state of things was ended.</p>

us light?</p>

<p class="right">
R. W. J.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It is true that authors differ
as to the age of Benedict Arnold. Appleton’s
Cyclopedia says he was born Jan. 3, 1740. Lossing’s
Cyclopedia of History gives the time as
Jan. 3, 1741, and other authorities do not agree.
We prefer to adopt the facts given by the Hon.
Isaac N. Arnold, of this city, who has just written
and published what there is good reason to believe
is the most carefully prepared and impartial
history of the American arch traitor of Revolutionary
times that has ever appeared. This
historian fixes Arnold’s birth on Jan. 14, 1741,
and his death on June 14, 1801, in London.</p>

while city police receive their appointments
from the city magistrates. The city of London
is guarded by 11,667 metropolitan policemen
and 842 city policemen. At one time the city of
New York was protected by metropolitan police,
but for various reasons, one of which was because
it restricted the free exercise of the spoils
system so common with city governments, the
act authorizing the appointment of such police
was repealed.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—All investigations prove conclusively
that it is impossible to determine to the
satisfaction of chronologists in general either
the day, month, or year of Christ’s birth. It is
almost universally admitted that this event
preceded the commencement of the Christian
era as now reckoned. St. Clement, the earliest
of the “church fathers,” fixes it on Nov. 18
in the twenty-eighth year of the Emperor
Augustus, a little more than two
years before the beginning of our era.
Since the death of Herod the Great,
according to Josephus, must have occurred before
Easter of B. C. 4, modern scholars are generally
agreed that Christ’s birth could not have
been later than B. C. 4; and there is strong reason
to believe that it was in B. C. 6 or 7. See McClintock
and Strong’s “Cyclopedia of Biblical
Literature,” under “Jesus Christ.” As to the
day and month of Christ’s birth the differences
are still more difficult to overcome. Modern investigation
is strongly against Christmas, or any
day in mid-winter, as unseasonable either for
the shepherds to be watching their flocks in the
fields, or for the congregating of the people from
all parts of the kingdom to be registered and
taxed, which was the occasion of Mary and Joseph’s
being at Bethlehem. These two arguments
are used, along with others, by the Biblical
scholars who hold severally to the opinions
that the nativity was not earlier in the year
than March, and, one party says, in March, another
in April or May, another in June, and still
others in July or August.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Whatever the explanation, and

to be a fact that the number of persons
charged with drunkenness in 1881 was
1,622 more than the number charged in 1880,
being 174,481 to 172,859. Furthermore, according
to the excise reports there was 7½ per
cent more beer drunk in 1881 than in 1880, the
total quantity being 970,785,564 gallons in a
population of 26,000,000, or about 31 gallons
for each man, woman, and child. The increase
in the population during the decade of 1871-1881
was 3,256,020, which is about 1.43 per
cent a year, while the increase in drunkenness
was nearly 1 per cent in the last year.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The following is the bill introduced
Jan. 31 in the General Assembly of this State,

County: “Be it enacted,” etc., “that they (the
directors) shall direct that elementary instruction
be given in physiology and hygiene, which
shall give special prominence to the effects of
alcoholic drinks, stimulants and narcotics upon
the human system. The certificate of qualification
held by any person who desires to teach
shall show that satisfactory examination has
been passed upon the effect of alcoholic drinks,
stimulants, and narcotics upon the human
system.” The advocates of the bill maintain
that, in view of the admitted evils of intemperance,
and particularly the moral and physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
injuries to individuals and society resulting
from the use of alcoholic drinks, stimulants,
and narcotics, it is of the highest practical importance
that the youth of the public schools be
properly instructed as to the effects of these insanity
engendering poisons. They say that
since the State, for purposes of revenue, and
also professedly with the desire of preventing
abuses, has authorized men and women to publicly
offer these poisons for sale, it is morally
bound to warn the youth of the land
not to use them except as medicine,
or in the arts, as other poisons are sometimes
used. They hold that those who admit the iniquities
of intemperance, but are opposed to
sumptuary legislation, cannot reasonably oppose
this recourse to educational remedies for
these appalling evils. If the law requires road
commissioners, when repairing the highways,
to hang out danger lights wherever they open
cess-pools and sewers, or make other perilous
chasms in the road, the advocates of this bill
argue that it is the duty of the State licensing
the opening of liquor shops to throw enough
light on the traffic to prevent young people
from falling into drunkenness in the dark.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Indiana Democracy met in convention

adopted the following resolution:</p>

<p>“The Democratic party is now, as it has always

is especially opposed to the proposed amendment
to the constitution of Indiana known as the prohibitory
amendment, and we are in favor of the
submission of the proposed amendment, as well
as other proposed amendments, to the people,
according to the provisions of the constitution
for its own amendment: and the people have the
right to oppose or favor the adoption of any or
all the amendments at all stages of their consideration,
and any submission of constitutional
amendment to a vote of the people should
be at a time and under circumstances
most favorable to a full vote, and therefore
should be at a general election.” The
Republicans, several days later, on Aug. 9,
adopted this resolution: “The Republican party
resolves that reposing trust in the people as the
fountain of power, we demand that the pending
amendments to the constitution shall be agreed
to and submitted by the next Legislature to the
voters of the State for their decision thereon.
These amendments were not partisan in their
origin, and are not so in character, and should
not be made so in voting upon them. Recognising
the fact that the people are divided in sentiment
in regard to the propriety of their adoption or
rejection, and cherishing the right of private
judgment, we favor the submission of these
amendments to a special election, so that there
may be an intelligent decision thereon, uninfluenced
by partisan issues.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, Wis.<br>
</p>

<p>What is the origin and history of the “Passion Play,”
of which we hear so much lately?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">F. Peck.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—This recent dramatical representation
of the passion of Christ claims its origin
and justification in sentiments akin to those
which it is said inspired the old religious
dramas, known as “Moralities,” or “Miracle
Plays.” The first composition of this
nature is ascribed to Ezekiel, a Jew,
who, in the third century, adapted the story of
Israel’s exodus from Egypt to the Grecian
stage. His object was to arouse the patriotism
of his exiled and despondent countrymen and
excite in them a hope for the re-establishment
of their kingdom in Palestine. In the fourth
century, St. Gregory Nazianzen, the Bishop of
Constantinople, having noticed the effect of the
Grecian drama upon the people, concluded that
the readiest method of extending the church of
Christ was the dramatic presentation of the sufferings
of its author, which he accomplished in
the drama entitled “The Passion of Christ.”
When the barbarians made their inroads into
Southern Europe, and the church began to extend
its influence northward into the lands of the
Germans, Normans, and Saxons, it found great
difficulty in coping with the fascination which
the heathen festivals and performances exercised
over the uneducated minds of the people.
In order to obviate this trouble, miracle plays
were introduced. Adapting the drama to the
surrounding circumstances, many of the heathen
characters, slightly changed, were retained. The
play was supplied with humor by the artful caprices
of the impersonated devil. In one representation
“Judas, assisted by the devil, who sits
upon the scaffold, hangs himself. When the
hanging is complete both slide down to hell on
a slanting rope.” Soon after the Reformation the
miracle plays began to decline, and now they
are performed in only a few places, mostly in
Southern Bavaria and the Tyrol. The passion
play of Oberammergau is famed the world over,
and attracts an immense concourse of visitors
from all lands whenever it is presented. In 1633
the flax in that neighborhood became diseased
and unfit for the spindle. To prevent the recurrence
of any such calamity the Oberammergau
peasants made a vow to God that every
ten years they would present the
sufferings of Christ upon the stage in this way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
This vow was kept until the beginning of the
present century, when the further performance
of the play was prohibited. Thereupon the peasants
appealed to King Maximilian, who granted
them permission to continue their celebrations,
providing certain objectionable features were
removed. This was agreed to, and in 1811 the
drama, written by Pastor Weise, was first presented
devoid of the devil and comic personages.
The gospel story commences with Christ’s triumphal
entry into Jerusalem, and closes with a
scene previous to the ascension. In a practical
manner, the plot is developed. The money
changers are driven from the temple in anger.
Judas smarts under the rebuke which
he received at the home of Lazarus.
They meet and plan the betrayal resulting
in the crucifixion. The part of Christ is
impersonated by a peasant. The ignorant inhabitants
still regard these plays as the most
impressive and effective method of teaching the
gospel and various moralities. The claim that
the passion play now occupying so much of the
public attention was inspired by religious motives
is rejected by the public generally, and is
ridiculed by the press. There is an all but unanimous
feeling of opposition in England and in
this country to having the passion of the Savior,
the solemn tragedy of Calvary, mimicked
on the stage by ordinary stage performers. This
feeling led the late Mayor Grace, of New York
City, to refuse to license the presentation of the
play in that city, and his successor, Mayor Edson,
has taken the same stand. Salmi Morse, the
manager, threatens to test the legality of this
interdiction. Such is the attitude of this matter
at present.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Garrison</span>, Iowa.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Referring to the explanation of the method of
determining latitude by observations on the
pole star, given in a recent issue of Our Curiosity
Shop, I venture to submit the following
indication of the common method by which sailors
ascertain their latitude at sea. It is true
that latitude may be determined by means of a
carefully observed altitude of the polar star,
providing the apparent time of observation can
be ascertained within a few minutes. This
method might frequently be used at sea when
the horizon is well defined if the star were of the
first magnitude; but being only of the second or
third it is difficult to determine the altitude
with certainty. For this reason the usual method
of finding the latitude at sea is by taking the
altitude of the sun when on the meridian. The
latitude of a place, being its distance from the
equator, is measured by the arc of the meridian
contained between the zenith and the equator;
hence, if the distance of the sun from the zenith
when on the meridian and the declination be
given the latitude is easily determined.</p>

<p>Kindly explain the editorial rules governing the receipt
and treatment of manuscript offered for publication,
whether intended for newspapers, periodicals,
or books. Suppose, too, that an author should send
the manuscript of a book to a publisher on the promise
that it would be returned if not accepted, how long
ought it to be before he should be notified of its receipt
and acceptance or rejection?</p>

<p class="right">

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There is no definite general rule for
these matters beyond the common understanding
that the editor must attend first of all to the
regular routine of his office, and manuscript
must wait, until he has time to read it. In
the case of contributions to a periodical, it is
understood unless contributors specifically request
the return of their contributions and inclose
postage stamps for this purpose, that the
editor, if he does not use them, is at liberty
to consign them to the waste basket.
It is not unusual for contributions to literary
magazines and standard reviews to lie on the
editors’ tables for a month or six weeks before
the verdict “accepted” or “rejected” is pronounced.
A glance at a contribution, even the
mere subject, indicates to the editor whether
the article is likely to suffer by delay. Stories
and many other contributions will keep; current
news and kindred matters will not. These
manuscripts must be read at once; those must
wait; and how long, only the editor is in the
position to determine. Even after articles are
accepted the same law prevails, and the circumstances
of each particular issue determine what
is to be used and what “held over.” It frequently
happens that editorials which have cost
the editor serious labor, and are actually in type,
are crowded out by unexpected events which
must take precedence, and are held back
by a succession of such events until
too stale to be used, and the writer is forced to
write “kill” over against the children of his
own heart and brain. Many a disgusted contributor
would feel less mortified and indignant
at the rejection of his offering if he could understand
all the circumstances of the case. The
contribution rejected to-day might have been
gladly accepted had it come a day sooner. An
article accepted yesterday and paid for, perhaps
never appears; why, only the editor can explain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Even champagne tastes flat after it has stood a
few moments; witticisms are still-born if not
ushered in at the right instant. The book-publisher
is subject to similar influences, but not in
the same degree as the editor of a newspaper or
review. But many a book manuscript has been
rejected because out of season. Many another
has been rejected because the writer was impatient
and the editor, rather than keep
him in such a mood and unwilling
to take the responsibility
of publishing what he had not read with critical
care, has relieved himself by returning it “with
thanks.” It is no slight matter for an editor to
read and so digest a book, in which the publisher
is asked to invest from $1,000 to $5,000, as to
enable him to pronounce a favorable judgment
with confidence. Of course long and carefully
prepared manuscripts, especially books, are entitled
to more consideration than ordinary newspaper
contributions; and should never be destroyed
until the authors have been courteously
notified that they are not wanted, and have had
ample time to send for them. In the supposed
case of the above question, acknowledgment of
receipt of the book manuscript should have
been mailed as soon as it came to hand,
unless it was received by express or as registered
mail matter, and from thirty to sixty days,
according to the length and nature of the book
would not be too long to grant the editor or
publisher before expecting a decision. Except in
special cases, editors of newspapers do not receipt
by mail for contributions sent to them.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The number of miles of railroad in
the world constructed prior to Jan. 1, 1881, was
226,442, of which sum 93,671 miles were within
the United States. Germany had built 21,037
miles; Great Britain and Ireland, 17,696;
France, 15,287; Russia, 13,571; Austria-Hungary,
11,471; British India, 8,615; Canada,
6,891; Italy, 4,999, and Spain, 4,264. During
the year 1881 the railway mileage of this country
increased to 104,813 miles, to which
the year 1882 added 10,821 miles, making
a grand total of 115,634 miles. To build these
great highways and properly equip them about
$5,750,000,000 have been expended. Iowa during
the past year took the lead, having constructed
953.37 miles, and Texas followed close
after with 817 miles of new road.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Any answer to such a question is
largely a matter of personal opinion. Among
political orators Patrick Henry, James Otis,
Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, Thomas Pike,

stand among the most illustrious.
As to pulpit orators, it would be

Our great poets have not been many. First
among them have been and still are, as regards
fame, William Cullen Bryant, Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow, George Denison
Prentice, and Nathaniel P. Willis. Whittier,
T. Buchanan Read, Holmes. Lowell,
Miller, Holland, Saxe, Morris, Mrs. Sigourney,

electric telegraph; Whitney, inventor of the
cotton-gin, and Howe, inventor of the first successful
sewing machine, are among the first of
the ten thousand American inventors who have
done the world noteworthy service. Edison and
several hundred other inventors, who have improved
upon the inventions of their predecessors
until they have doubled, trebled, and in
some instances quadrupled their value to the
world, are quite as worthy to be remembered.</p>

<p>These grants, amounting in the aggregate to
215,203,807 acres, or over 355,000 square
miles, are only about 6,000 miles less
in area than all the original thirteen
States of the Union taken together, and is
more than 60 per cent greater than the total
area of the German Empire. Fortunately for the
country, a number of these grants have been
forfeited; yet, as above shown, 42,847,403 acres,
or more than the total area of England and
Wales together, had been actually certified to the
States and roads named before June 30, 1879;
and many acres have been certified since that
time. The exact amount down to date is not yet
published. To avoid taxation, the railroads entitled
to public lands delay taking their certificates
until the settlement of the country and
opportunity for selling make it to their interest
to do so. A large amount of the land covered by
the above grants will be certified to the grantees
on demand.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The population of the entire globe

Hardly two original investigators agree. In
this country the estimates of Drs. Behm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Wagner are generally accepted as the most reliable,
yet their latest figures differ from those of
two years before by upward of 22,000,000. Then
they stated the population of the entire globe at
1,455,923,500, whereas now they state it at
1,433,887,500, distributed as follows:</p>

<table class="autotable">

<p>One might infer from this that instead of
increasing, as would be naturally expected, the
human race is dying out: but closer inspection
shows that the estimate of the population of
China has been reduced about 55,000,000.
Accepting this and all the other estimates, there
seems to be an increase in other countries of
about 33,000,000; part of which is due to the
fact that the geographers had the benefit of the
census takers in different countries in 1880
and 1881, showing the growth of five to ten
years. The total population of the United States
in 1880, according to the revised census, is 50,155,783.</p>

<p>What is the origin of the expression “A soldier’s
drinking cup,” as applied to a human skull?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Wm. A. T.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Thomas Middleton was a dramatic
writer who flourished in the early part of the
seventeenth century. In “The Witch,” one of
his most celebrated plays, when “the Duke”
takes a bowl and is told that it is a skull, he exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">“Call it a soldier’s cup;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our Duchess, I know, will pledge us, tho’ the cup</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was once her father’s head, which, as a trophy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll keep till death.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The barbarous custom of converting the skulls
of enemies into drinking cups was a common
one in ancient times among the fierce tribes of
Northern Europe; and was not unknown to the
more civilized regions of the South. The Italian
poet, Marino, makes a conclave of friends in
Pandemonium quaff wine from the skull of
Minerva. In his “Wonder of a Kingdom,” Torrent
makes Dakker say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Would I had ten thousand soldiers’ heads,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Their skulls set all in silver, to drink healths</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To his confusion who first invented war.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The old Scandinavian sagas represent as
among the delights of the immortals the felicity
of feasting and drinking to drunkenness from
the skulls of the foes they had vanquished on
earth. Mandeville goes further, and represents
the Guebres as exposing the dead bodies of their
parents to the fowls of the air until nothing but
the skeletons remained, and preserving the
skulls to be used in a spirit of devotion as drinking
cups.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—General William W. Averell was
born in the State of New York in 1830. At the
age of 25 he graduated at West Point, and began
his military career as Lieutenant of mounted
riflemen on the Western frontier. In the rebellion
he took an active part in the battles of Bull
Run, Yorktown, Williamsburg, Fair Oaks, Malvern
Hill, Fredericksburg, Kelly’s Ford, Opequan,
Fisher’s Hill, and various other engagements
in West Virginia, Tennessee, and the
Shenandoah Valley, at the same time being successively
brevetted Major, Lieutenant Colonel,
Colonel, Brigadier General, and Major General,
U. S. A. In 1865 he resigned, and in the following
year represented the United States as Consul
General in Canada. Afterward he retired to accept
the Presidency of a manufacturing company
in New York.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">O. N. Adams.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Prince Alexander M. Gortschakoff,
who was at that time the Russian Minister of
Foreign Affairs, when invited, at a critical time
in the history of our civil war, to associate Russia
with England and France in their unfriendly
attitude toward the United States, involving,
among other things, a proposition to recognize
the independence of the Southern Confederacy,
positively declined. The following extract from
one of his state papers at that juncture shows
his disposition toward this country, which
he quickly emphasized by dispatching a
Russian fleet to New York as a proof of his
friendship and sincerity; an act which greatly
alarmed and disconcerted both England and
France, since many of their politicians jumped
to the inference that there was a secret treaty of
alliance between the two countries, and that in
case of a rupture Russia would openly take sides
with the United States. These are the words of
the dispatch alluded to, and Americans should
not soon forget them:</p>

<p>“The North American Republic not only presents
itself to us as an indispensable element of
the international balance of power, but, besides
that, it is a Nation toward which our most
august Emperor and the whole of Russia have
always had a most friendly disposition, because
both countries are in the ascendant period of
their development, and seemed called to a natural
unity of interests and sympathies, proofs of
which have already been given on both sides.”</p>

<p>“Replying to your favor of the 8th inst., we
may say that there has been considerable
activity of late in the construction of very large
locomotives, the most approved railroad practice
having changed materially within the past few
years with respect to the weight of the engines
employed. We have recently built some very
heavy locomotives for the Northern Pacific Railroad,
which weigh, in working order, exclusive
of the tender, about 115,000 pounds. The tenders
with coal and water weigh about 65,000
pounds each, additional, making the total
weight of engine and tender some ninety net
tons. These engines have cylinders 20x24

<p>The Central Pacific Railroad Company have
recently built in their Sacramento shops some
very heavy locomotives with four pairs of driving
wheels coupled and a leading four-wheeled
truck, which weigh in working order, exclusive
of the tender, about 123,000 pounds. The
weight of the tender, with coal and water, is about
65,000 pounds, making the total net weight of
the engine and tender some ninety-three net
tons. These engines have cylinders nineteen
inches in diameter and thirty inches stroke, and
are probably at this time the heaviest engines in

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="smcap">Peoria</span>, Ill.<br>
</p>

<p>1. What may be fairly regarded as the average annual
butter product of a good class of dairy cows? 2.
Is not $50 an exorbitant price to pay for an average
cow?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Young Housekeeper.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Of course the butter product depends
on the kind of stock, the pasturage and
winter feed, the care of the cattle, and the skill
and industry of the butter-maker. The following
statement of Mr. Wm. Guinter, of Twin
Grove, Wis., shows the average annual product
of butter realized by him from six cows, together
with the average value of this product: “I have
kept a strict account for one year of the income
from six cows. I have sold 1,185 pounds of
butter, and counting four pounds a week of
cream and butter for family use of
four persons, increases the total product
to 1,393 pounds. The highest price
received per pound was 38 cents, and the lowest
was 16 cents, making an average of 26 cents.
The whole amount realized, then, was $362.18,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
or $60.36 a cow. I have my cows come in fresh
in the fall on account of making a better quality
of butter and getting a better price. I keep them
in good condition all winter: feed chopped corn
and oats and all the clover hay they want. Feed
about three quarts of chop twice a day
to each cow. My cows are only the common
grade. I have clover pastures, but never turn
cattle in till the first or middle of May, so as to
let it get a good start, and then the pasture will
be good all summer. Some of my neighbors ask:
‘Do you think it pays?’ I do it whether it pays
or not: but I think it does. You can’t expect a
great yield of milk from straw and dry cornstalks.
What stock you keep, keep well.
It will pay.” 2. Obviously the value of a good
milch cow depends somewhat on the locality. A
cow is worth more in the immediate neighborhood
of a good market than in a region remote
from such a market. With the above average
product of a good cow, in pounds, to guide one,
every intelligent person can form a judgment as
to whether it will be profitable for him, taking
the price of butter and feed in his own market,
to pay $50, or more or less, for a good cow.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">St. Paul.</span>, Minn.<br>
</p>

<p>Does music weaken metallic or other bridges? If
so, please explain why.</p>

<p class="right">
A. M. G.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Measured vibrations are more trying
to any kind of bridges, and particularly to
suspension bridges, than irregular agitation.
Music alone would not strain a bridge enough to
injure it materially; but a regiment of troops
keeping step to music when crossing a suspension
bridge would subject it to a very severe strain.
Consequently it is customary to stop the
music before troops reach the bridge, and let
the men break step, and march more or less irregularly.
The reason of all this is obvious.
The structure will naturally suffer least strain
when at rest. When in uniform motion the
bridge acquires a momentum equal to its entire
suspended weight multiplied by the velocity of
the motion. It is manifest that, in the case of a
heavy structure, a uniform downward vibration,
be it ever so small, would develop a momentum
of many tons in the direction of a breaking
strain. The same disturbing forces acting irregularly,
so as to counteract one another,
would be far less trying to the structure.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—You probably refer to what is known

campanile, or bell tower, commenced in 1174,
by Bonannus of Pisa, and William of Innsbruck.
It is cylindrical in shape, 50 feet in diameter,
179 feet high, and leans about 13 feet out of
perpendicular. It is divided into eight stories,
each having an exterior colonnade, or gallery.
The top is reached by 330 steps. It was not
purposely built to lean. The foundation
settled more on one side than on
the other until it reached the present
inclination, which it has maintained with
scarcely any perceptible increase for hundreds
of years. The defect in the foundation was discovered
before its completion, and the upper
part of the structure was built in a manner to
counteract in part the inclination; and the
grand chime of bells, seven in number, of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Oxford</span>, Iowa.<br>
</p>

<p>What proportion of the State debt of Virginia do
the “Readjusters” intend to repudiate? What part of
it was created during the late civil war? Is the State
really unable to pay its creditors? Give a few of
the chief features of this Virginia debt controversy.</p>

<p class="right">
F. G. A.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The whole of the Virginia State
debt was contracted before the war, for railroads,
canals, turnpikes, and public buildings,
including penal and charitable institutions. Of
course any debts made in aid of the rebellion
were wiped out by section 4 of the fourteenth
amendment to the Constitution of the United
States. On Jan. 1, 1861, the State owed $33,248,141.63.
On Jan. 1, 1870, owing to non-payment
of interest during the intervening ten
years, the debt had accumulated to $45,660,348.
The constitutions of Virginia and West
Virginia (the latter of which had been constructed
out of Virginia during the war) both
provided for an equitable apportionment of
this joint indebtedness; but the two
States have never agreed on a division. In
March, 1871, the State of Virginia passed an act
to set aside one-third of the debt to West Virginia,
which contained about one-fifth of the
population and one-third of the territory of the
original State and a trifling proportion of the
public improvements for which the debt was
created, and to give the bondholders new bonds
payable in thirty-four years with 6 per cent interest
annually, and certificates promising that
the payment of the remaining one-third would
be provided for in accordance with such settlement
as should thereafter be made with West
Virginia. This left as the debt of the present
State of Virginia $29,614,793 (report of Second
Auditor, 1881). The State’s creditors hastened
to exchange old evidences of indebtedness
for the new bonds, which went forward rapidly
until about two-thirds of the whole were refunded,
when, a majority of Readjusters having
been elected to the Legislature, the process of
refunding was stopped. The old bonds left outstanding
by this sudden change of policy constitute
what is known as the “Peeler debt.” The
interest coupons on the new bonds were “receivable
for taxes and all dues and demands
against the State,” and have been honored, but
the interest on the Peeler debt has been paid
only in part. In 1879 the creditors proposed the
exchange of the bonds then outstanding for new
bonds bearing 3 per cent interest for ten years,
4 per cent for twenty years, and 5 per cent for
ten years, making an average of 4 per cent. The
total principal of the debt at this time was $29,367,958.06.
Accordingly the “McCulloch bill”
was passed, binding the State to this settlement:
and bonds to the amount of $8,000,000 were
issued under this law. Senator Johnston, in
an article in the <cite>North American Review</cite> setting
forth the above facts, claims that, had the
law been faithfully executed, the surplus revenue
of 1879, after paying interest on all the State’s
indebtedness and all State expenses of the
government and the public schools, would have
been more than $400,000, which would have
gone to pay off so much of the principal.</p>

<p>Senator Riddleberger, in his reply to Mr. Johnston,
in the <cite>North American Review</cite> for April,
1882, declares that instead of there being any
surplus in the State Treasury at the close of
1879, the Readjusters found, on their accession
to power, Jan. 1, 1880, “a great mass of the proposed
McCulloch tax-receivable certificates
ready for issue. They were forced to borrow
money to run the government. Half a million
of money, due by defaulting treasurers, was
uncollected and unsued for. Over $1,500,000
had been diverted from the schools. The charitable
institutions of the State were on the verge
of bankruptcy.” Nevertheless, the boast of the
Virginia press, that the mining, manufacturing,
and agricultural resources of the State are
developing more rapidly than before the war, is
generally believed to be true; the crops of the
six principal cereals and potatoes, tobacco, and
hay in 1881 amounted to $44,280,690, and the
live stock to $33,538,877; the taxable value of
property, real and personal, even at the low assessment
prevailing, is given at $308,455,135:
facts which lead the world to believe that Virginia
is perfectly able to pay her debt. Taking
the total debt under the McCulloch bill at what
Senator Mahone placed it at the time of the passage
of the bill, the annual interest would have
amounted to not quite $990,000, which, added
to $565,000 for public schools and arrearages,
and $765,000 for current expenses of the
State Government, would make but $2,320,000.
That same year the net revenue, if
faithfully collected, would have amounted to
$2,606,425.36, so that there would have been a
remainder of $286,500 to apply as a sinking
fund. Since then the Riddleberger bill has become
a law, and the debt has been scaled down
to about $20,000,000, instead of about $33,000,000,
which is nearly what it would be had the
McCulloch law been carried out. As there is no
provision for the payment of the $15,239,370
set over to West Virginia, and which the latter
repudiates on the ground that she has offsets
to all her proportion of the original debt, it appears
that the total loss to the State’s creditors,
adding the accrued interest on the latter amount,
is over $36,000,000, or fully 80 per cent of the
amount conceded by the act of 1871 to be the
total sum then due them.</p>

The barrel should be of laminated or Damascus

Length of barrel, 28 to 32 inches; bore, 10 to 12

guns the Greener and Scott stand very high;
among Belgian, Charles Daly; among American,
Parker, Colt, Remington, Nichols &amp; Lefevre, and
Baker; and in the Northwest, the Abby gun,
manufactured in this city, is a favorite. Good

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Fourche</span>, D. T.<br>
</p>

<p>Were there historians before Berosus, Manetho, and
Herodotus, whose works have come down to us in
Greek, Latin, or other European languages?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">H. M. Eastman.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Herodotus is the oldest of the Greek
historians. He was born 484 B. C. He is generally
recognized as the father of history.
Berosus was an educated priest of Babylon, who
lived about 260 B. C., and wrote in Greek three
books of Babylonian-Chaldean history, the materials
for which he declares he found in the
ancient archives of Babylon. Manetho was
an Egyptian historian, of the priestly order,
who lived in the reign of Ptolemy Soter, in
the beginning of the third century
B. C. He, too, obtained the materials for
his works from the temple records at his command,
from which he wrote two works, one on
the religion and the other on the history of
Egypt. Only fragments of the writings of
Berosus and Manetho remain—preserved in the
works of Josephus, Eusebius, and other later
writers. There are historical records on the ancient
monuments of Egypt, Babylon, and
Assyria which date back to earlier days, but except
the historical books of the Old Testament,
beginning with those of Moses (who was born
1738 B. C.), and some of the writings of Confucius
(born 551 B. C.), there is nothing antedating
the writings of Herodotus that is regarded
as history.</p>

<p>Why is east and west lead ore always in cubes, while
it is not always so with lead found in north and south
lodes?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">C. A. Damon.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The primitive form of galena, or
sulphate of lead, crystals is the cube. Whenever
left free to crystallize, subject to no extraneous
force or pressure, this ore takes that
form. At cross veins it takes modified forms,
the angles and edges of the cubes being replaced
by faces, so as in many cases to form octahedral
crystals. Now just why lead seems to have been
more free to take its simple primitive form
when crystallizing in east and west veins or
lodes than in veins running in other directions
is still largely a matter of theory or conjecture.
Some theorists think that the north and south
magnetic currents, to which the polarity of the
magnetic needle is attributed, have something
to do with this phenomenon, but a great many
other wise people think nobody knows.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The following is a full list of the

States of America, Mexico, Nicaragua, Honduras,
Guatemala, San Salvador, Costa Rica, the United
States of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia,

Andorra, San Marino, and Monaco; the only independent

savage), Liberia, Orange River Free State, Transvaal
Republic, Morocco, and Abyssinia; the only
independent nationalities of all Asia—Persia,
Burmah, Afghanistan, Beloochistan, Siam,
China, and Japan; finally the Sandwich Islands.
This makes a total of fifty-seven nations universally
recognized and diplomatically treated
as such, although several of them, like Afghanistan
and Burmah, are little more than nominally
independent, and two of them—Monaco,
with an area of only 5¾ square miles, or less
than a Congressional township in this country,
and a population less than 6,000, and San Marino,
with an area of barely 23-8/10 square miles
and less than 8,000 inhabitants—are so insignificant
in comparison with their great neighbors
that it seems a mockery of the name to call
them nations. Indian tribes, Esquimaux, tribes
of Africa, Asia, and Australia, although taken into
treaty relations as independent or quasi independent
peoples, are never correctly spoken of
as nations in the sense in which the term is
used in international law.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="smcap">Huston, D. T.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Nine-tenths of the persons who have inquired
of me about Dakota land entries since
my brief note in <span class="smcap">The Inter Ocean</span> did
not inclose stamps or postal cards for replies.
I have answered all that did observe
this plain business rule. I am no land agent,
nor have I land to sell, so I ask you to publish
the following notes, which will answer nearly
all the questions asked me. [A person should
not invite a general correspondence through a
paper like <span class="smcap">The Inter Ocean</span>, “whose parish is
the world,” unless he is prepared to employ one
or two stenographic correspondence clerks. In
almost every instance that we have published
contributors’ invitations to Farm and Home
readers to write to them, these rash friends have
sent us word that they were deluged with correspondence.—<span class="smcap">Ed</span>].
Of course, in the beginning
all the government land in Douglas
County, D. T., was subject to
entry under the pre-emption and homestead or
timber-culture acts. But at present there are
not more than three hundred vacant quarters in
the county, and, since the timber-culture act
only allows one such claim in each section,
these unentered quarters can be taken only under
the homestead and pre-emption acts. A timber-culture
claimant is required to plant ten
acres of trees and protect and cultivate them
for eight years. As no settlement is required,
these claims are in good demand, the relinquishments
selling for from $200 to $400, owing to
location. Under the pre-emption law the settler
pays $2 to file his claim. After he has lived
upon the land six months final proof can be
made by paying $1.25 per acre. Under this
entry the claimant is allowed thirty-three
months in which to prove up, at the end of
which time, if he has not complied with this requirement,
the land is again open for settlement.
Under the homestead law the settler
pays $14 to enter. He has then six months in
which to begin his residence on the land, after
which time, if he has not complied with the
law, it can be contested on the ground of abandonment.
Where a settler is unable to begin his
residence and settlement within the time allowed
by law, he can dispose of the claim by
relinquishing to the government and allowing
some one else to enter. Nearly all the land
throughout the central part of the county has
been taken; and what government land there is
remaining is mostly in the western part and
around the borders of the county. Relinquishments
range in price from $50 to $300, owing
to location and quality of the land.</p>

<p>Had the Celts, at the time of the invasion by Julius

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">J. H. G. Rogers.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—That they had any written records
there is great reason to doubt, although there
are inscriptions on certain rude stone monuments
in parts of Wales, as in the southeastern counties
of Munster, Ireland, consisting of long and
short lines, known as Ogamic characters, the
antiquity of which is not well determined. As
far as deciphered, these inscriptions throw no
direct light upon the origin of the Celtic race.
Their spoken language, reduced to writing after
the introduction of Christianity, is the only key
of any importance to their origin. This
language plainly marks them as an early
offshoot of the Aryan family, the common
Asiatic stock from which all the ruling
races of Europe have descended. The descriptions
left by the Romans of the aborigines of
Britain at the time of the Roman conquest represent
them as fierce, cruel barbarians. Neither
Cæsar’s Commentaries nor the writings of
Tacitus and other historians of the period of the
Roman domination convey evidence that the
Britons had any knowledge of letters until the
Roman and Greek characters were taught them.
Neither do these historians preserve any oral
traditions of the British bards or druids calculated
to shed much light upon the early history
of the Celtic race.</p>

<p class="right">

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The capital of the first colonial government

1699. It was transferred to New Orleans in
1723. New Orleans was the capital of the Territory
of Orleans, organized in 1804 out of a
part of the vast Louisiana purchase. In 1812
the State of Louisiana was formed with New
Orleans as the capital. In 1847 Baton Rouge
was made the seat of the State government, and
it remained so until after it came into possession
of the Union army during the late war. A provisional
government was established at New
Orleans in 1864, and the State constitution of
1868 made that city the capital; but by the new
constitution of Dec. 2, 1879, the honor of being
the seat of the State government was restored to
Baton Rouge, where it was established in 1880.</p>

<p>What are the distinctive differences between the
“staples” of Angora and Cashmere goats? Which
staple is the more valuable? What are the present
prices of the same in the markets of this country?
Give a few chief facts as to these two breeds of goats.</p>

<p class="right">
T. S. R.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Angora goat takes its name
from the Turkish city and village of Angora, in
the interior, mountainous region of Asia Minor
(about 220 miles E. S. E. of Constantinople),
which exports 2,000,000 lbs of mohair annually.
The animals are highly prized, and command
from $250 to $1,250 for the finest males and
$200 to $900 for females, there being several
varieties. The Cashmere goat is named from
Cashmere, a province between India proper and
Thibet. The animals are most numerous in
Thibet, but most of the wool—or mohair, as it is
technically termed—is manufactured in Cashmere,
the 16,000 or more looms of which turn
out about 30,000 shawls every year, worth in
London from £100 to £450. There are marked
differences in the “staples” of these two species
of goats. They both have two coats. In the
case of the Angoras there is a coarse, short hair
close to the skin, and a long, curly, outer covering
of the nature of wool, very soft and silky
and, in good varieties, from seven to nine inches
long. This is the more bulky and valuable part
of the fleece. The Cashmere goat, on the contrary,
has a coarse, outer coat of different shades
from gray to black and a fine undergrowth of
beautifully soft, silky texture, almost downy.
It is perfectly straight, of a uniformly grayish
color and glossy luster, and is fully double the
length of the Angora staple, the best grades
measuring eighteen inches. This is combed out
of the animal’s coat in the spring, when it begins
to be shed, and the product is so light that
it has been said that the average yield is but
three ounces per goat, which would require the
product of ten goats for the manufacture of a
shawl a yard and a half square. It is certain,
however, that the yield of the finer animals
ranges from seven to nine ounces. The value of
this mohair in Cashmere is from 30 to
40 cents a pound. It is not exported
to this country to such a degree
as to establish a market quotation.
There is some of the Angora mohair imported
for manufacture in our Eastern States, at prices
ranging, according to quality, from 60 cents to
$1 a pound. The Angora goat has been successfully
introduced into the British colonies of
South Africa. Cape Colony alone exported in
1878 the sum of 1,300,585 pounds, valued
at £105,313, or about 32 cents a pound. It is
believed that it can be raised with profit in the
mountainous parts of Georgia and Alabama, and
still farther north; and in the mountainous districts
of California and Oregon.</p>

“The $20 gold piece here designated gives a
good deal of trouble to curiosity hunters and
coin collectors in general; very much as is the
case with the silver dollar of 1878 with eight
feathers in the eagle’s tail. There is no premium
on either of them. There is no certain
history of the Moffat &amp; Co. pieces. They were a
private coinage and issued under miner’s law;
and all ’49 Californians know the potency or
persuasive powers of that law. The quality or
fineness of the pieces is below standard and
their value much below our current $20 piece.
The San Francisco mint was established in
July, 1852, and very soon after that all private
coinages ceased. Most of these pieces find their
way into the brokers’ offices and are sold only at
bullion prices.”</p>

<p>Where does Mocha coffee come from, and what
makes it so much higher priced than other coffee?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Edward Palmer.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The genuine Mocha coffee is produced
in the province of Yemen, South Arabia.
It takes its name from Mokha, the chief port of
exportation, on the Red Sea. Very little of it,
and that of inferior quality, is ever seen west of
Constantinople. Mr. W. G. Palgrave, the Arabian
traveler, says: “Arabia itself, Syria, and
Egypt consume fully two-thirds of the annual
crop, and the remainder is almost exclusively
absorbed by Turkish and Armenian esophagi.
Nor do these last get for their share the best or
the purest. Before reaching the harbors of Alexandria,
Jaffa, Beyrout, etc., for exportation
beyond there, the northern bales have been
sifted and resifted, grain by grain, and whatever
they may have contained of the hard,
rounded, half transparent, greenish-brown
berry, the only one really worth roasting and
pounding, has been carefully picked out by experienced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
fingers, and it is the less generous
residue of flattened, opaque, and
whitish grains which almost alone goes
on the shipping. So constant is
this selecting process that a gradation
regular as the degrees in a map may be observed
in the quality of Mokha, that is Yemen, coffee,
even within the limits of Arabia itself in proportion
as one approaches to or recedes from,
Wadi Nejran and the neighborhood of Mecca,
the first stages of the radiating mart.” About
10,000 pounds of this coffee are exported annually
through the port of Mokha, says another
authority; but this seems to be consumed, as
Mr. Palgrave says, mainly in Africa and Turkey.</p>

<p>The Mocha sold in the markets of Western
Europe and America is from the East Indies.
Some of it even never crossed the Atlantic, being
produced in the West Indies or Central or
South America. The really exquisite flavor of
this choice, small berried coffee, together with
the almost fanatical prejudice of the Turks for
it, because it is raised in Arabia, and the limited
production, sufficiently account for the high
price it commands.</p>

<p>A party of ladies studying Shakespeare are deeply
interested in the Baconian theory. We find very little
concerning it in books. Can you tell us if there are
any valuable magazine articles on this subject, and
where they may be found? What guide is there to
periodical literature?</p>

<p class="right">

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Happily we do now know where to
direct not only this correspondent but other inquirers
where to find a complete index of all
periodical literature in the English language of
any importance, whether upon the above-named
subject or any other. It is in “An Index to
Periodical Literature,” by William Frederick
Poole, LL. D., Librarian of the Chicago Public
Library: published by James R. Osgood &amp; Co.,
Boston. This is the only work of the kind, except
Dr. Poole’s first and second indexes,
published the one in 1848, and the
other in 1853, both of which are out of print
and were mere pamphlets in comparison with
this noble volume, a royal octavo of 1,442 pages.
Fresh from the press, it is brought down to a
very recent date. The answers to the above
questions and another, from two correspondents
who wish to read up on the protective tariff
and free trade controversy, may serve to illustrate
the advantages of this invaluable index.
Under William Shakespeare there are
eight and a half columns of references by title
to articles in American and English reviews and
magazines on Shakespeare and his works, all of
which are alphabetically arranged. Running
along the “A” column we come to “Authorship
of” (Shakespeare), “and Lord Bacon. (Delia
Bacon) Putnam, 7:1.—Frazer, 90:164. Same
art, Liv. Age, 123:131.—Chamb, J., 18:87—Nat.

Liv. Age, 51:481.—Harper, 34:263.—Nation,
2:402.—Scrib., 9:392.” This answers Mrs. M.
B. W.’s question as to where she and her Shakspearean
Club are to look for periodical literature
on the Baconian theory of the authorship
of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Now turn to “Tariff,” and there are nearly
two columns of titles of articles on this subject
and where to find them; among them being the
following, arranged under the head of “Protective
Tariff.”</p>

<p>“Protective, (J. C. Pray) Hunt, 2:119.—(H.
J. Burton) Hunt, 11:254.—(M.

118; 24:99, 116.—So. Lit. Mess., 8:421.”</p>

<p>Turning to the introduction of the
book we find all the above abbreviations
clearly explained, and the place
of publication of each of the several periodicals
referred to. For example: “Putnam,
7:1,” stands for Putnam’s Magazine, number 7,
page 1; “Blackw. 80:616,” signifies Blackwood’s
Magazine, number 80, page 616, and so on.
Every public library in the land—city, village,
college, high school, whatever its name—needs
such a guide as this to periodical literature, and
it is easy to see that no private library of any
pretensions can do without it.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The old Roman year contained but
355 days, divided into twelve lunar months,
with an intercalary month thrown in at certain
intervals, as became necessary, to atone for the
fact that it requires more than twelve precise
lunar months to make a year. This arrangement
led to great confusion, and Julius Cæsar, in the
year B. C. 46, remedied the trouble in large degree
by the introduction of what is known as the
Julian calendar, which regarded the year as
composed of 365¼ days. This was a great improvement,
but as a matter of fact the natural
year contains 11 minutes 10 seconds less than
365¼ days, which difference amounts in a hundred
years to 18 hours 36 minutes 40 seconds,
or a little more than three-fourths of a day. As
a consequence, between the year A. D. 325—when
the Council of Nice established the rule
for the determination of Easter Sunday—and
the year 1582 there was found to be an accumulated
error of ten days. Whereas the sun
had crossed the equator at the vernal
equinox of A. D. 325 on March 21, it crossed it
in 1582, according to the Julian calendar, on
March 11. Pope Gregory XIII., resolved on ending
the confusion attendant upon this imperfection
of the generally accepted calendar, ordained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
that what according to this mode of
reckoning would have been Oct. 5, 1582, be
reckoned as Oct. 15; and to prevent a repetition
of the error he further ordained that every hundredth
year should not be a leap year, excepting
the year 2000 and every four hundredth year
thereafter. Manifestly the omission of an entire
day every four hundredth year would be too
much by about one day, since, as above shown,
the error in the Julian mode of reckoning
amounts only to 18h. 36 min. 40 sec. in a hundred
years, or about three days in four hundred
years. This correction the Gregorian amendment
effects by the rule above stated, which
took the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 out of the
list of leap years, and left the year 2,000 in
that list. This leaves but the small difference
of 36 min. and 40 sec. in a
hundred years between the civil and natural
years: which amounts to no more than twenty-two
seconds a year, or about six hours in 1,000
years. In England the change from the old
style of reckoning to this new style was not
ordered until 1751, by which time the error that
was but ten days in Gregory’s time had grown
to eleven days. The order took effect in England
and the Colonies as regarded all official
dates and reckoning, in September, 1752, when
eleven days were left out of the calendar by
reckoning Sept. 3 as Sept. 14. This explains
apparent discrepancies between authors who
wrote in the latter half of the last and the early
part of this century. For example, some early
biographies of Washington say that he was born
Feb. 11, others that he was born Feb. 11, O. S.,
or Feb. 22, N. S. Some biographical sketches of
John Adams, Washington’s successor, declare
that he was born Oct. 19, 1735, without indicating
that this was according to the old reckoning,
while others state that he was born Oct. 30.</p>

<p>Enumerate the acts passed since the Republicans

people generally, and not some corporation or monopoly

party has never passed any such laws.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">C. S. Holley.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It is useless to waste words on men
so ignorant or politically mendacious as “elderly
Democrat.” The following memorandum is for
the benefit of younger and fairer minded men.
First of all there is the series of acts ending in
the preservation of the Union and the emancipation
of 4,000,000 men who were so far from
being “monopolists” or holders of corporation
shares that they were slaves; as they would be
to-day had the Democrats remained in power.
It would take columns to enumerate the laws
brought forward by Republicans and enacted
since they came into power which
have immensely benefited the people
at large, and not “only monopolies,”
as you express it. Among these are the laws
which have brought cheap postage and rapid
postal transportation; the homestead and timber
culture acts; the establishment of the only
thoroughly secure national paper currency and
general banking system this country has ever
enjoyed; the resumption of specie payments in
the face of Democratic and Greenbacker opposition;
the maintenance of the public credit
against rebellion in the South and the Democracy
in the North, re-enforced subsequently by
the Greenback party, both clamoring for total
or partial repudiation; the abolition of all duties
on tea and coffee; the establishment of State
schools of agriculture and industrial science,
endowed by government land grants; the promotion
of American inventions, manufactures,
and mining, until it is considered that this
country leads the world in useful inventions,
and the capital invested
in its factories is nearly three times as great
as it was in 1860, when the Republicans came
into power—the number of hands employed being
2,738,885, or more than double as many; the
amount paid in wages, more than two and a
half times as much; the value of farms, forest,
mine and other materials consumed (nearly all
American) about three and a third times as
much; and the value of the product almost three
times as great. As some of the consequences of
the above industrial legislation, the public
lands are passing into the hands of the
people in homesteads and timber culture
claims alone at the rate of 8,000,000 acres
a year; and the twenty years from 1860
to 1880 added as many farms to the
cultivated domain of the country as all its
previous history. Gold, notwithstanding all the
products of our fields and mines, not only
stopped flowing out of the country, as it had
done during all our former history, but began
to pour in from other lands, millions on millions.
While throughout all the vast interior of the
country, notwithstanding the marvelous multiplication
of farms, farm products are higher
than in 1860, and nearly all manufactured goods
that enter into general consumption are lower.
In the same brief period the assessed taxes on
real estate and personal property have mounted
from $12,084,560,005 to $16,902,993,543.</p>

<p>Please tell us the cause of earthquakes. Are they
due to internal convulsions of the earth or to atmospheric
disturbances?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Jacob Sloneker.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—According to that eminent physicist,
F. W. Rudler (see his contribution to the
Encyclopedia Britannica on “Earthquakes”),
“even at the present day, after all that has been
written on the subject, but little is known as to
the origin of earthquakes.” The general opinion
of investigators is that these agitations proceed
from within outward, and are not of atmospheric
or other external origin. True, Professor
Alexis Perry, of Dijon, France, thought
he had discovered relations between the
ages of the moon and these recurrences, which
seemed to sustain the theory of Zantedeschi,
that the liquid nucleus of the earth responds to
the moon’s attraction in tides, somewhat as the
ocean does: but the theory that the earth has a
liquid nucleus covered with only a thin, solid
crust, is losing adherents continually. The
theory of vibration communicated by meteoric
impact has been advanced as accounting for
some earthquakes. Another theory is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
earthquakes are caused in some instances by
steam from water rushing into the bowels of
volcanoes, or from explosions of pent-up gases,
generated by chemical decomposition of minerals.
Others believe that many of these phenomena
are due to magnetic disturbances, following
eruptions in the sun. The prevailing
opinion still is that whatever their origin,
whether of one cause, or various causes, the
vibrations of every earthquake can be traced to a
focus within the earth, and that this lies
directly beneath the point of greatest disturbance
on the earth’s surface. After the great
shock at Naples in 1857, Mr. Mallet, aided by
the Royal Society, by determining the wave
paths of the shock at twenty-six different stations,
was able to locate the focal depth of the
earthquake at about five and a half miles; and
Dr. Oldham, by observations on the wave effects
of the earthquake which occurred at Cachar,
India, on Jan. 10, 1869, found that the focus of
disturbance must have been about thirty miles
below the surface. This is very near the maximum
depth at which any earthquake is likely to
originate, if we accept the reasoning of
that most eminent of all investigators of
this class of phenomena, Mr. Mallet, of
Dublin, Ireland. There are credible
records of between 6,000 and 7,000 earthquakes
between 1606 B. C. and 1842 A. D. Professor
Fuch’s more careful observations of recent
years show that there were probably many
times that number of unrecorded ones, since he
registered ninety-seven during the year 1875
and 104 during 1876. In view of this fact this
subject appears to be one of the most interesting
problems of nature and is attracting growing
attention, which, it is hoped, will presently
lead to definite, satisfactory conclusions.</p>

<p>Having seen questions in <span class="smcap">The Inter
Ocean</span> inquiring about Dakota, and seeing
no answers from this county, I concluded to
write and tell what I know of it. Aurora is
the fourth county from the eastern boundary
and the third from the southern. It is considered
by all who have traveled over it as one of
the finest in Southern Dakota. The county is
forty-eight miles long and twenty-four miles
wide. In the northwestern portion are situated
the “Wessington Hills.” These extend from
northeast to southwest as far as the Missouri.
Among them are beautiful broad valleys and
lakes of clear water. The climate is all that can
be desired. Last summer the days were warm
and the nights invariably cool, so that after a
hard day’s work you could lie down and rest
sweetly. The past winter here, as in all other
parts of the Northern States, has been very cold
and stormy. One month, however, would take
in all of the very cold weather. One
foot would cover all the snow that we have
had this winter. The soil is a black loam, varying
in depth from one to six feet. The shallowest
we have found on our land is eighteen inches,
and the deepest four feet. It is very productive.
Last year the crops yielded as follows: Corn
from 25 to 60 bushels per acre, wheat from 20
to 40 bushels, oats from 50 to 80 bushels, barley
from 30 to 60 bushels, rye from 40 to 60
bushels, flax from 7 to 22 bushels, buckwheat
from 10 to 30 bushels, potatoes from 100 to 300
bushels, and all other vegetables yielded enormously.
The way this county is filling up is
wonderful. One year ago last fall there were
only about 150 people in the county, and to-day
there are between 450 and 500, and scores more
coming on every train. If emigrants continue
coming as they have done for the last eighteen
months, this county will soon be filled up.
Spring has already opened out with us, and
farmers are putting in their wheat and barley.
Plankington, our county seat, which hardly had
a name eighteen months ago, is to-day a fine
little village of over 700 inhabitants. With
early and deep planting this country will grow
almost anything.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">S. S. Coleman.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The annual income of the Czar of all
the Russias probably averages a great deal more
than $25,000 a day. The crown domains comprise
more than a million square miles, covering an
area exceeding that of all our New England,
Middle, and Southern States. These include cultivated
lands, pastures, and forests in different
parts of this vast empire, which embraces in its
despotic arms more than one-sixth the entire
land surface of our globe. Besides the revenue
from the above estates, the Czar derives a large income
from gold, silver, copper, and other mines in
Siberia. The actual total of his immense revenue
from all these sources is not stated in the
government budgets or finance accounts, the
crown domains being considered the private
property of the imperial family. In a British
consular report of 1867 the total income of the
imperial family is estimated at £2,450,000 sterling,
which is an average of about $33,500 a
day. The imperial contributions to charities,
schools, theaters, etc., are estimated by the same
authority at about £450,000, leaving a net sum
of £2,000,000 a year to “keep the family.”</p>

<p>What was the most destructive battle of the late
civil war; and how did it compare with the battle of
Waterloo as to numbers engaged and loss of life?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Inquirer.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The heaviest losses suffered by
either side in any single battle of the late war
were at Gettysburg. The numbers engaged and
the losses are stated differently by different
writers. Before the Committee on the Conduct
of the War, General Meade, the Union commander,
said: “Including all arms of the service,
my strength was a little under 100,000—about
95,000.” Understanding this to include
General French’s 7,000 men, who were by a
blunder kept idle at Frederick, and about 4,000
more of French’s force, who had been detailed
for special service—none of whom were brought
into this battle—it would appear that Meade’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
force at Gettysburg was about 84,000 men of
all arms. This corresponds very nearly
with General Humphrey’s statement that the
Army of the Potomac in this action comprised
70,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry, with an
artillery force of 300 guns. Of the Confederate
forces, General Humphrey says that General
Lee entered Pennsylvania with 85,000 infantry,
8,000 cavalry, and a due proportion of artillery.
Greeley’s “American Conflict” says: “Lee’s
army, carefully counted by two Union men independently,
as it marched through Hagerstown,
numbered 91,000 infantry, with 280
guns and 6,000 cavalry, while not less than
5,000 cavalry under Stuart advanced into Pennsylvania
without passing through Hagerstown.”
The Union loss was 23,190, of whom 2,834 were
killed, 13,713 wounded, and 6,643 missing. The
Confederate loss is not officially stated. It is
estimated by one writer (in the American
Cyclopedia) at 5,000 killed, 23,000 wounded,
and 8,000 unwounded prisoners—a total of 36,000,
which is evidently an exaggeration. Greeley’s
“American Conflict” estimates Lee’s loss at
28,000, of whom 18,000 were killed and
wounded, and 10,000 were unwounded prisoners;
while J. Watts de Peyster, in Johnson’s
Cyclopedia, estimates Lee’s loss at 31,600—18,000
killed and wounded, and 13,600 missing,
which includes the unwounded prisoners
in our hands. In the battle of Waterloo, the
French army under Napoleon I. (according to P.
Nicholas, in Haydn’s Dictionary of Dates)
numbered 71,947 men and 246 guns, and the
allies 133,661 men of all arms and 260 guns—English,
under Wellington, 67,661; Prussians,
66,000 men. The loss of the allies was 22,976:
of whom 4,206 were killed, 14,539 wounded,
and 4,231 missing. The French loss was 18,500
killed and wounded, and 7,800 prisoners,
total 26,300; but other accounts, including
some French writers, make their loss about 30,000,
the figures given in most English and
American cyclopedias.</p>

taken as an expose of the actual use made of the
laws in thousands of instances: “I have been a
reader of your worthy paper from the first year
of its publication, and as I live away out here in
the far West I take a great interest in the doings
of Congress in regard to the public lands, of
which <span class="smcap">The Inter Ocean</span> has so much to say.
Now my theory and belief is, and always has
been, that the public lands should be given to
those who will cultivate and improve them—actual
settlers who will make for themselves and
their descendants a home—and not throw this
munificent gift of the National domain into the
hands of land-sharks and speculators. Every
person taking a claim, and those now holding
claims under any of the different acts of Congress,
should occupy and cultivate such
lands according to the spirit and intent
of the laws granting them the
same. I think Congress made a very grave
error in giving persons who had filed their entries
of land under the homestead act the
privilege to pay $1.25 per acre for it instead of
residing on the land five years, thus giving
those who never occupied the land, and probably
never will, a great advantage over the first
settlers on homestead land, who, in order to
hold their claims, had to make the required improvements
and have an actual residence. I believe
from my personal knowledge that three-fourths
of the land acquired under the above
act passed into the hands of capitalists and
speculators. The bogus homesteader would go
to some money lender and get enough money to
prove up on his land—say $200 for 160 acres
and $50 or $100 besides—giving a deed or mortgage
on the same as security. In this way the
poor, honest home-seeker is cheated out of the
land. There are a great many claims out here,
especially timber claims, held by persons who
have not fulfilled the requirements of the law,
but as the law is now administered they can
hold them with impunity. A great share of the
land now covered by timber-culture claims on
file is in reality far more effectually covered
with rank weeds than with growing timber.
Under the present system this law is of little
value, and keeps off the sincere home-seeker,
who would improve the land and help to build
up schools and churches, and make for himself
and family a much needed home.”</p>

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The first knowledge of Mexico that
reached the Spaniards otherwise than by vague
and uncertain stories of natives of the West Indies
came through two expeditions fitted out by
Diego Velasquez, who made the first European
settlements in Cuba. The first of these, under
the command of Cordova, sailed from St. Jago
de Cuba, Feb. 8, 1517, and landed on the shores
of Yucatan and Campeachy. The second, commanded
by Grijalvo, landed at various places
on the coast, but returned without penetrating
into the interior or making a settlement. It
carried back such reports of the high civilization
and great wealth of Mexico, learned through
the natives, as served to intensify the determination
of Velasquez to explore, and, if possible,
conquer the country. He fitted up a fleet of
eleven small vessels and placed them in command
of Fernando Cortez, who set sail from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Cuba, Feb. 10, 1519; landed near the present
city of Vera Cruz, on March 4, and became the

</p>

<p>How did the loss of lives and property in the great
fire in Chicago compare with the losses in what are
distinguished as the great fires of London and Moscow?
Give a list also of the other principal fires
recorded in history, and oblige</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Constant Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The loss of life and property in the
willful destruction by fire and sword of the
principal cities of ancient history—Nineveh,
Babylon, Persepolis, Carthage, Palmyra, and
many others—is largely a matter of conjecture.
The following is a memorandum of the chief
conflagrations of the current era:</p>

<p>In 64, A. D., during the reign of Nero, a terrible
fire raged in Rome for eight days, destroying
ten of the fourteen wards. The loss of life
and destruction of property is not known.</p>

<p>In 70, A. D., Jerusalem was taken by the Romans
and a large part of it given to the torch, entailing
an enormous destruction of life and
property.</p>

<p>In 1106 Venice, then a city of immense opulence,
was almost wholly consumed by a fire,
originating in accident or incendiarism.</p>

<p>In 1212 the greater part of London was
burned.</p>

<p>In 1666 what is known as the Great Fire of
London raged in the city from Sept. 2 to 6, consuming
13,200 houses, with St. Paul’s Church,
86 parish churches, 6 chapels, the Guild Hall,
the Royal Exchange, the Custom House, 52 companies’
halls, many hospitals, libraries, and other
public edifices. The total destruction of property
was estimated at $53,652,500. Six lives
were lost, and 436 acres burnt over.</p>

<p>In 1679 a fire in Boston burned all the warehouses,
eighty dwellings, and vessels in the
dock-yards; loss estimated at $1,000,000.</p>

<p>In 1700 a large part of Edinburgh was burned;
loss unknown.</p>

<p>In 1728 Copenhagen was nearly destroyed;
1,650 houses burned.</p>

<p>In 1736 a fire in St. Petersburg burned 2,000
houses.</p>

<p>In 1729 a fire in Constantinople destroyed
12,000 houses, and 7,000 people perished.
The same city suffered a conflagration in
1745, lasting five days; and in 1750 a
series of three appalling fires: one in January,
consuming 10,000 houses; another in April destroying
property to the value of $5,000,000,
according to one historian, and according to another,
$15,000,000; and in the latter part of
the year another, sweeping fully 10,000 houses
more out of existence. It seemed as if Constantinople
was doomed to utter annihilation.</p>

<p>In 1751 a fire in Stockholm destroyed 1,000
houses; and another fire in the same city in
1759 burned 250 houses with a loss of $2,420,000.</p>

<p>In 1752 a fire in Moscow swept away 18,000
houses, involving an immense loss.</p>

<p>In 1758 Christiana suffered a loss of $1,250,000,
by conflagration.</p>

<p>In 1760 the Portsmouth (Eng.) dock-yards
were burned, with a loss of $2,000,000.</p>

<p>In 1764 a fire in Konigsburg, Prussia, consumed
the public buildings, with a loss of $3,000,000;
and in 1769 the city was almost totally
destroyed.</p>

<p>In 1763 a fire in Smyrna destroyed 2,600
houses, with a loss of $1,000,000; in 1772 a
fire in the same city carried off 3,000 dwellings,
and 3,000 to 4,000 shops, entailing a loss of
$20,000,000; and in 1796 there were 4,000
shops, mosques, magazines, etc., burned.</p>

<p>In 1776, six days after the British seized the
city, a fire swept off all the west side of New
York city, from Broadway to the river.</p>

<p>In 1771 a fire in Constantinople burned 2,500
houses; another in 1778 burned 2,000 houses;
in 1782 there were 600 houses burned in February,
7,000 in June, and on Aug. 12, during a
conflagration that lasted three days, 10,000
houses, 50 mosques, and 100 corn-mills, with a
loss of 100 lives. Two years later a fire, on
March 13, destroyed two-thirds of Pera, the
loveliest suburb of Constantinople, and on Aug.
5 a fire in the main city, lasting twenty-six
hours, burned 10,000 houses. In this same fire-scourged
city, in 1791, between March and July,
there were 32,000 houses burned, and about as
many more in 1795; and in 1799 Pera was again
swept with fire, with a loss of 13,000 houses, including
many buildings of great magnificence.</p>

<p>In 1784 a fire and explosion in the dock-yards,
Brest, caused a loss of $5,000,000.</p>

<p>But the greatest destruction of life and property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
by conflagrations, of which the world has
anything like accurate records, must be looked
for within the current century. Of these the
following is a partial list of instances in which
the loss of property amounted to $3,000,000 and
upward:</p>

<p>When was the Lady Elgin lost, on Lake Michigan
and how many persons were lost, and saved?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">John Miller.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The steamer Lady Elgin was cut to
the water’s edge by a sailing vessel named the
Augusta, heavily loaded with lumber, which
struck her amidships, during the night, Sept. 8,
1860. She sunk almost immediately. Carrying
an excursion party from Chicago to Milwaukee
at the time, she had about 400 passengers on
board. The disaster occurred about twenty-two
miles north of Chicago, nearly off Glencoe.
Many of the passengers and crew got on rafts
and portions of the wreck, and drifted toward
the land. Some of these came ashore between
Glencoe and Evanston; but the most of them,
after getting within hail of the beach, despite
the best efforts of citizens and students of
Evanston and Winnetka to assist them,
were swallowed up in the breakers and
carried out into the lake by the terrible
undertow. Men with ropes around
their chests plunged into the breakers, seized
exhausted, drowning men and women, and were
dragged in by main strength of men at the lines.
Conspicuous among these noble men was Mr.
Edward W. Spencer, of Rock Island, Ill., then a
student at Garrett Biblical Institute, who saved
fourteen or fifteen passengers, persisting until he
was utterly exhausted; an example of heroism
which was suitably commemorated afterwards
by the presentation of a memorial watch and
chain, given him by citizens of Chicago and
Evanston. Of the total list of passengers only
about one-fourth were rescued; 297 perished.</p>

<p>What are the area and principal natural features of
Australia, and the nationalities and chief occupations
of its population?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Charles L. Brickwell.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Australia, often spoken of as an
island, is about ten times the size of Borneo, the
largest island of the world properly so called,
and is nearly half the size of South America. To
be more specific, it measures about 2,500 miles
from east to west, and 1,950 from north to
south, containing an estimated area of 3,000,000
miles. This is about the same as the entire
extent of the United States, exclusive of Alaska.
Along the east and west coasts the country is
broken, rising at no great distance from the
sea into a succession of mountain ranges; but
the vast interior is almost as level as a gently
undulating ocean-bed, which it evidently
was at no very distant period—geologically
speaking. It seems to be for the most part a
great sandstone basin, rising toward the coast in
nearly every direction. The mountain range
in the southeast, known as the Australian Alps,
rises to a height of 7,000 feet; the granite and
syenitic mountains on the west coast range
from 800 to 3,000 feet in elevation, and those
along the coast of Queensland, and along the
greater part of the north coast, from 1,000 to
4,000 feet. There are immense quantities of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
coal in Eastern Australia, rich gold mines, some
silver, and an abundance of iron, copper, and
tin. The broken and much of the mountainous
regions are well wooded, but the interior
is comparatively naked, and
much of it wears a parched look, like
the dry, treeless plains of Eastern Wyoming and
Colorado, which are available for flocks and
herds the most of the year, but not cultivable
with profit without artificial irrigation. There
are millions of acres of fine agricultural and
grazing lands without entering this interior
basis to any great distance; and the governments
of the several provinces are offering liberal
inducements to settlers. Few of the rivers
of this vast country are navigable to any great
distance, although several of them may be made
so for a large part of the year by slight improvements
of the channels. Conspicuous among the
latter are Murray River, 1,100 miles long; the
Roper and the Victoria. The regions beyond
the seaboard are not likely to
develop rapidly until means of transportation
are extended. The railroad mileage
of Australia is only a little over 4,042 miles, or
about the same as that of Minnesota, which is
thirty-six times smaller in area and began to be
settled much later. The telegraph lines measure
over 30,000 miles. The climate of the
Southern half of Australia is quite similar to
that of Southern Brazil or Cuba, and that of the
greater part of the rest of the continent is a
good counterpart of that of Southern Europe.
The total population of the five provinces of
Australia, by the census of 1881, is as follows:</p>

<p>The above does not include aborigines, estimated
to number 80,000. The increase by immigration
is not rapid. The population is mostly
of British origin, but it embraces also nearly
10,000 Polynesians and 25,000 Chinese. The
chief occupations are agriculture, grazing, mining,
building, and commerce. Manufactures do
not flourish, the colonies being dependent almost
entirely upon the United Kingdom for
manufactured goods. The chief exports are
wool, hides, preserved meats, copper, lead, coal,
and gold. The total quantity of gold mined in
Victoria alone, from the discovery in 1851 to
the end of 1880, amounted to 49,500,000 oz.,
valued at $990,000,000. The government of
the several provinces is similar to that of the
provinces of the present Dominion of Canada
before their union.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Alderney, Jersey, and Guernsey are
small islands in the British Channel, just off
the coast of Normandy, France; from which the
first, an isle of about four square miles in area,
is separated by only a very narrow strait. Jersey,
about sixteen miles off the coast, is a much
larger and more fertile island, being about
eleven times the size of Alderney. While the
cattle of the three islands are all believed to
have come from one common Norman stock,
and pass under the common name of the Alderney
breed, the Jersey cattle have been greatly
improved by careful in-breeding, and are better
milkers as to quantity, though not as to quality,
than the native cattle of Alderney. Few cattle
are exported from the latter island, while a considerable
number of Jersey cattle are exported
to England and this country, where nearly all
the representatives of what is known as the Alderney
breed are Jerseys. It would not be correct
to speak of Alderneys and Jerseys as distinct
breeds.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—1. By the “high seas” is meant the
open sea: that is the waters outside of the
civil jurisdiction of any country, which the
law of nations limits to one marine league, or
three geographical miles from shore. 2.
The Great Lakes are regarded, beyond

high seas. 3. In the event of crimes
committed on the high seas, parties charged
therewith are subject to the jurisdiction of the
Federal or United States courts in the district
which the vessel first enters after the commission
of the crime, or in the district where the offender
is found. The courts of States bordering on the
great lakes have jurisdiction concurrent with
that of the United States courts where it can be
shown that the crime was committed
within their limits, which extend to the
central line of the lakes bounding them. 4.
In the clause of the Constitution which
reads: “The migration or importation of
such persons as any of the States now existing
shall think proper to admit shall not be prohibited
by the Congress prior to the year 1808,”
etc. The word “persons” was understood to mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
African slaves. This form was adopted to avoid
the use of the word slave in the Constitution, the
very thought of which was repugnant to Washington,

that instrument, whether from North or South.
The slave trade, in conformity with the above

<p>From this it appears that nearly one-third of
Ohio, more than three-fourths of Michigan,
about two-fifths of Indiana, a little more than
one-fourth of Illinois, about three-sevenths of
Iowa, and almost nine-tenths of Nebraska remained
unimproved as farm property at the
time of the last census. In settled States, the
number of acres included in cities, towns, and
villages, in roads, lakes, and navigable streams,
will reduce the proportion of “unimproved
acres” by about 2 per cent of the total area. The
statistician of Indiana computes that there were
in 1879, 249,686 acres, or 1⅛ per cent of the
total State area, embraced in roads outside of cities
and incorporated towns. 2. The total immigration

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—In 1807 the British Government
abolished the slave trade in all British vessels
and in British waters. The agitation
against slavery was kept up in Parliament from
that time, growing more and more irresistible
every year, and spreading out into
the farthest provinces, until in 1832
the negroes of Jamaica revolted, under
the belief that emancipation had actually
been decreed and that their masters were holding
them in slavery against law as well as
against natural right. The atrocities to be expected
in a servile insurrection ensued; hundreds
of lives and millions of property were destroyed.
When the terrible tidings reached
England it added new fuel to the emancipation
agitation, already at white heat, and in 1833 the
famous English emancipation act was passed.
The government apportioned £6,161,927 among
the owners of the slave population, of 309,338
persons; and after four years apprenticeship all
of these former slaves became absolutely free.</p>

<p>How and when did the political nicknames “Hunker”
and “Barnburner” originate in the State of New York?</p>

<p class="right">
J. H. P.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Democratic party within New
York State became badly divided soon after the
inauguration of Mr. Polk, in 1845, owing to the
slights put on Governor Silas Wright, of that
State, to whose immense popularity Polk really
owed his election. Wright could not carry all
his friends over to Polk, as is shown by the fact
that he was elected Governor by 10,030 majority,
while Polk carried the State by 5,106. This,
however, decided the electoral count in his
favor. Polk was really a weak man, and showed
it in nothing more than in his jealousy of
Wright and annoyance at the general ascription,
of his election by the organs of both parties, to
Wright’s influence. He tendered Wright
the choice of places in his Cabinet under
constraint of the general wish of the party, and
knowing that this statesman felt bound to
retain the high office to which the people of
New York had exalted him. Wright declined, but
asked that Azariah C. Flagg, of New York, be
made Secretary of the Treasury, and he understood
the President to promise this; yet
afterward the latter declined to make the appointment,
and gave the portfolio of Secretary
of State to ex-Governor Wm. L. Marcy, of New
York, who was by no means friendly to Wright.
The Collectorship of New York, it was understood,
would be given as Governor Wright and
ex-President Van Buren should request, but
here again the President disappointed them.
All this reminds us forcibly of the divisions in
the Republican ranks in the same State, due to
the Garfield-Conkling feud. The trouble
rankled, and the Democratic party became divided
into two pronounced factions before the
election of delegates to the next gubernatorial
convention. There were the administration
Democrats, calling themselves Conservatives,
and the “sore-heads” of those days, stigmatized
as Radicals, because, among
other things, they were affected with
anti-slavery, or “free-soil” sentiments; whereas
the administration party was strongly pro-slavery.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
In the Democratic State Convention,
held at Syracuse early in 1847, the latter faction,
by political manipulation, secured the organization
of that body, and decided nearly all
the contested seats in their own favor and made
the State ticket and the State Committee to suit
themselves; in other words, “carried off the
hunk,” and fairly won the nickname of “Hunkers.”
The other faction, led on by Governor
Wright’s friends, Mr. Van Buren, Colonel Samuel
Young, Michael Hoffman, and others, refused
to support the ticket, and as a consequence
the Whigs carried the State by over 30,000 majority
in the gubernatorial election. One of the
Hunker orators likened the Wright and Van Buren
faction to the Dutch farmer who burned his
barn to rid himself of the rats, and thenceforward
the name Barnburners was fastened on
them, and the two nicknames, Hunker and
Barnburner, were bandied back and forth until
after the latter joined with the Liberty party, in
1852, to support Mr. Van Buren as the Free Soil
candidate for the Presidency. There is no difference
of opinion as to the origin of the
term Barnburner as above given, but
Webster’s dictionary defines hunkerism as hostility
to progress: “Bartlett’s Americanisms” defines
“Hunkers” as a name given to a faction of
the Democratic party because of devotion to old
principles, from the Dutch “honk, place, post,
home;” while others insist that the term grew
out of the triumph of the administration faction
at the Syracuse convention referred to above,
which led them to imagine that they were “all
hunk,” as the New York boys exclaim in certain
games when they have reached their goal or
“home” without being intercepted by the contestants
on the other side of the game. Hunk,
in this sense, is evidently a corruption of the
Dutch “honk” or “home,” handed down by the
Dutch children. As the Hankers did “carry off
the hunk at Syracuse, did imagine themselves
all hunk,” and were “hostile to progress,” either
or all of the above explanations may be accepted
without doing violence to history, whatever the
consequences to philology.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Messages from the President and
other matters of great importance are usually
referred to a committee of the whole House,
where general principles are digested in the
form of resolutions, which are debated and
amended until they get into a shape that meets
the approbation of a majority. These resolutions,
after being reported and confirmed by the
House, are then referred to one or more select
committees, where they are reduced into the
form of bills or joint resolutions. It is found
that the sense of the House is better learned in
committee, because in all committees everyone
speaks as often as he pleases. No gag law can
be applied in committee by moving the previous
question. The form for going from the House
into the committee of the whole is for the
Speaker, on motion, to put the question that the
House do now resolve itself into a committee of
the whole to take into consideration such a
matter, naming it; to which the deliberations of
the committee must be confined. If determined in
the affirmative, he leaves the chair and takes a
seat elsewhere, as any other member, and the
person appointed chairman seats himself at the
clerk’s table. The Speaker usually appoints a
chairman, but the committee has full power to
set him aside and select its own chairman. In
case of the committee’s getting into violent disorder
the Speaker, who is clothed with authority
to call in the Sergeant-at-arms, if necessary, to
enforce order, may take his chair, and at the tap
of his gavel every member is required to take his
proper seat, such action having the effect to dissolve
the committee. Cases of this kind are
rare. Usually when the committee is ready to
rise the chairman rises, the Speaker immediately
resuming the chair; if the business is unfinished,
the chairman of the committee reports progress
and asks permission for the committee to sit
again, which the House may or may not consent
to. If the business is finished the chairman
tenders his report.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Samuel Adams was one of the very
first who organized measures of resistance
against the encroachments of Great Britain on
the rights of the colonies. He drew up the famous
petition of the General Court of Boston to
the King, in 1764, against taxation on trade. He
was elected a Representative in the Massachusetts
House of Representatives in 1765, was
chosen Clerk, and served in that body ten years.
It is said that he was the first to suggest the congress
of colonial delegates that assembled in
New York in 1765, and was the father of the
non-importation agreement of 1789, intended
to check the use of British manufactures and
other foreign imports and foster home manufactures
and, still more, a spirit of independence.
He was Chairman of the committee that
waited on the Royal Governor and Council in
1770, on the day after the Boston riot and massacre,
and demanded the removal of the troops.
He was one of the signers of the declaration of
independence: was one of those who matured
the plan of the Continental Congress, to which
he was a delegate from Massachusetts from 1774
to 1782, and signed the articles of confederation,
which were the constitution of the country
until replaced by the present Federal Constitution.
He was Lieutenant Governor of
Massachusetts from 1789 to 1794, and Governor
from 1794 to 1797. He was born in Boston
Sept. 27, 1722, graduated at Harvard in

<p>To settle a dispute please inform us through Our
Curiosity Shop whether the United States ever issued
a coin called the “York shilling?” Was there not a
coin of some kind called a York shilling?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The United States certainly never
did mint any such coin. Neither did New York
itself before the adoption of our present Constitution,
under which individual States are not
permitted to coin money. Most of the original
thirteen States had issued bills of credit during
colonial times, which had depreciated in the
several colonies in different degrees, according
to provisions made for their redemption and
other incidents. In New England, after the
adoption of the Federal decimal system, the
pound in paper currency was worth only
$3.33⅓ and the shilling 16⅔ cents, equal to six
shillings to the dollar. This standard prevailed
also in Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana,
Illinois, Missouri, Mississippi, Alabama, and
Florida. In New York the paper currency
pound was worth only $2.50,
and so the shilling was reckoned
but 12½ cents, equal to eight shillings
to the dollar. This last is the “York shilling,”
a money of account. The only coin that ever
passed by that name is the Spanish real, known
along the Ohio and Lower Mississippi as “a bit,”
which, until a few years ago, was current through
the country at 12½ cents, the value, as above
shown, of the New York paper currency shilling
of the olden times. In Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Delaware, and Maryland the pound was worth
$2.70, making the shilling worth 13½ cents, or
7s. 6d. to the $1. In Georgia and South Carolina
the pound was worth $4.20, and the shilling
21-3/7 cents, or 4s. 8d. to the dollar. Such
was the force of habit that, long after the old
colonial paper money passed out of use, people
continued to buy and sell and keep accounts
in pounds and shillings; and schoolboys were
required to familiarize themselves with the rules
for reducing the several State currencies to Federal
currency.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Thomas Wilson.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—1. In 1799, after laying siege to the
stronghold of Acre, Syria, for sixty-one days,
Napoleon Bonaparte resolved to raise the
siege and return to Egypt, where his presence
was demanded by the threatening state of
affairs, which culminated at last in the great
battle of Aboukir, in which he defeated Murad
Bey, for the second time, with great slaughter.
There is no doubt that, although victorious over
the Ottoman and Egyptian armies, the almost
utter annihilation of the French fleet by the
English and Turks in the famous naval battle
of the Nile, some months before this, and the
menacing state of affairs in France, made it prudent
for Napoleon to take advantage of the
prestige of this victory to retire from Egypt,
leaving the government of the country he had
conquered to General Kleber, who soon after this
totally defeated the Ottoman army, 70,000
strong, before Heliopolis. Not until after
Kleber was assassinated and months of the unwise
administration of his successor, General
Menou, did the insurrection fomented by the
English, and finally assisted by an English
naval and land force, compel the French
under Menou, to withdraw from Egypt,
nearly two years after Bonaparte himself
had returned to France. Taken all in all
the French expedition into Egypt, planned by
Napoleon Bonaparte, although distinguished by
several brilliant exploits, must be regarded
from a political and military standpoint as a
failure. 3. So was the expedition to Moscow,
which, after a succession of victories, ended in a
disastrous retreat in midwinter, forced upon
the French, not by arms, but by threatening
starvation and other results of the burning of
Moscow. 4. The Duke of Wellington, although
several times compelled to retreat before
French armies during campaigns in the
Netherlands and in Spain, never suffered
any disasters comparable with those inflicted
on Napoleon; neither did he ever exhibit, even
at Waterloo, where, with the allies, he had
double the strength of the French army, such
marvelous generalship as made Napoleon Bonaparte
for many years more than a match for all
the powers of Europe combined, the arbiter of
all their thrones.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>.—“Funded debt” is government or
corporation indebtedness in the form of bonds
or other evidences of money stipulated to be
paid at stated intervals, and usually bearing interest
payable annually or oftener. “Floating
debt” is indebtedness, such as unsettled accounts,
scrip in the nature of due bills, etc. not
funded. A sinking fund is money set apart out
of taxes, earnings, or other income, for the redemption
of government or corporation bonds

<p class="right">

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>.—Similar requests are made by C. A.
Brace, Esq., of Persia, Iowa; L. R. S., Cameron,
Neb.; Q., of Elk Grove, Wis., and several others,
some of whom desire to know what success has
attended experiments in artificial incubation
with modern apparatus. Conflicting reports as
to this latter question, together with the fraudulent
methods taken by some persons engaged
in vending pamphlets that cost the publishers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
not to exceed 8 cents a copy, containing directions
for making apparatus of this sort, at the
extortionate price of $2, and selling ready-made
incubators at exorbitant prices, has made
caution advisable in treating this subject. Reports
received within the past six weeks from
twenty different persons, who have experimented
with incubators, indicate that in
about twelve cases out of twenty the
average success is encouraging, and
in the cases of the others the average results are
quite discouraging. It is very certain that in a
climate incident to such sudden and extreme
changes as ours success demands skill and constant
attention. None but absolutely fresh eggs
must be selected, a temperature hardly varying
from 103 deg., and a proper degree of moisture
must be maintained, with sleepless vigilance.
Let the eggs be chilled even for a few minutes
and the consequences are disastrous. For a
comparatively inexpensive incubator make a box
4 feet long, 3 feet wide, 6 inches deep, outside
measurement, with a tight board lid and a zinc
bottom; using boards 1¼ inches thick, nailed or
screwed together. This is the heater. Of the same
kind of boards make an egg-drawer 4 feet long,
2 feet 11½ inches wide, 5 inches high, outside
measure, and 4 inches deep on the inside, with
slats nailed in crosswise, instead of a board for
the bottom. The slats better be of inch-thick
lumber, not more than 1 inch wide, and set one
inch apart. Over these slats on the inside tack a
piece of coarse sack the full length and width
of the box. Draw it tight and tack it
securely to the slats and the ends of
the box. Next make a frame 3 feet 7 inches
long and 32 inches wide, using inch-square
strips for the end pieces and inch-wide strips of
half-inch thickness for the sides. Strain stout
muslin over this frame and tack it firmly. Lay
this, muslin side down, on the coarse cloth in
the egg drawer. This is to support the eggs.
Next bore twenty half-inch holes in each side of
the egg drawer, 1¾ inches apart, and as close to
the frame with the muslin bottom as can be
done and yet allow this frame to slide easily
underneath twenty slats a half-inch square
each, which must be run through the box from
hole to hole, to keep the eggs in position. Arrange
the eggs between these slats, resting on
the muslin of the muslin frame. It will be seen
that by moving this frame about two inches
backward or forward the eggs can be turned
half over. Make a box of precisely the same
length and breadth as the heater, but eight
inches deep instead of six. Nail on a tight
bottom of inch flooring stuff; bore twelve half-inch
holes in this bottom, into which insert as
many tin tubes of the same diameter, seven
inches long, for ventilators. Fill all the space
between the pipes with sawdust to within about
an inch of their tops. Next set the egg drawer
on top of this ventilator box, and set the heater,
the first box described, on the top of the egg
drawer. Take common inch-boards, one foot
wide, and nail one on each side and across one
end of this pile of boxes, driving the nails along
the lower edge of each board into the ventilator
box, and along the upper edge into the heater
box; raising the latter off of the egg-drawer
barely enough to let the latter slide easily back
and forth between the heater and ventilator.</p>

<p>As the incubator stands now, the egg-drawer
is protected from the cold, underneath, by the
ventilator box with about six inches of sawdust:
but it must be similarly protected on the
sides and top. Set this nest of boxes, as now
arranged, on a couple of trestles made of pieces
of scantling, four feet eight or ten inches long,
with short legs eight inches long, and build another
box 27 inches high (outside) around them,
long enough and wide enough to form a sawdust
chamber 8 inches wide along both sides
and the back end of the incubator, and rising
8 inches higher than the top of the heater. Next
get two tin pipes, 12 or 13 inches long and
about 2½ inches in diameter, seamed together,
as solder melts; also get two such pipes about 6
inches long, and two elbows. Bore a 2½-inch
hole through the sawdust-box and the heater-box
entering the latter about 9 inches from the
front and 2 inches below the lid, and slide one
of the longer pipes through these holes. Attach
one of the elbows and one of the 6-inch
pipes outside. Put the other pipe into the
heater from the opposite side, about 9 inches
from the back end of the heater. Two kerosene
lamps, set on brackets, on the outside of the
sawdust box, with their chimneys thrust up into
the short pipes, will supply all the heat that is
required for hatching the eggs. If the lamps
smoke, drop them low enough to admit a little
air to enter between the chimneys and the inside
of the pipes. Opposite where each of these tin
flues enters the heater, bore three three-quarter-inch
holes through the top of the heater,
nine or ten inches apart, in a line about three
inches from the side. Slide six tin tubes of the
same diameter, fifteen or sixteen
inches long, through these holes to
within a half-inch of the zinc bottom
of the heater. Now fill the sawdust
chamber around the incubator and on top,
putting earth instead of sawdust just around
the hot-air flues, to avoid fire. As the zinc directly
under where the hot-air flues enter the
heater is apt to get overheated, it is best before
covering the heater with sawdust to lay a piece
of zinc or tin, about a foot square, on the zinc
bottom as an equalizer of the temperature.
Keep a thermometer in the egg drawer to test
the temperature. This drawer will hold about
250 eggs.</p>

<p>This is the incubator; directions for using it
will be given hereafter.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">NEW YORK IMMIGRATION COMMISSION.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Barnard</span>, Ill.<br>
</p>

<p>Who was the first to propose Castle Garden for the
benefit of foreign immigrants? Is the board of management
a National or a State organization? How did
it originate?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Anna Sierle.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The pitiable condition in which immigrants
were landed in New York, the cruelties
inflicted upon them in many cases in overcrowded
emigrant ships, the extortions and
downright frauds practiced upon them when they
were put ashore like so many cattle, and left to
shift for themselves in a strange city, without
language to make their wants known, began to
attract the attention of humane public officers
and merchants of that city at an early day. The
outrages multiplied, and the importance of providing
some remedy grew with the rapid increase
of foreign immigration, which swelled
from 22,633 for the whole United States in 1831,
to 104,565 in 1842. The Legislature of
New York State was appealed to, and
on May 5, 1847—in which year the rate of
foreign immigration more than doubled upon
that of 1842, the total number received rising to
234,968—it created the present Board of Commissioners
of Emigration of the State of New
York, which has been in successful operation ever
since, and has proved one of the most beneficent
institutions of the land. It consists of nine members,
six of whom are appointed by the Governor
with consent of the Senate, while the other three
are the Mayor of the city and the Presidents of
the German Society and the Irish Emigration
Society. All of these serve without compensation.
The law makes it their duty to provide suitable
quarters for the reception of alien passengers arriving
at New York; to care for the sick and helpless
among them; to protect them from extortion,
fraud, and impositions of any kind; to aid
those who wish transfer to the railways and other
transportation routes to the interior of the country;
to assist such as wish to remain in the city
to obtain work, and, in general, to give them trustworthy
information and advice, and guard their
interests. For this purpose they were authorized
to collect of vessel owners $2.50 for each passenger,
until 1871, when it was reduced to $1.50.</p>

<p>In 1855 the city of New York leased Castle
Garden to the Commissioners for an immigrant
landing depot, and it was opened for this purpose
in August of that year. It occupies the extreme
southern point of the city at the junction of the
North River, or Hudson, with the East River. A
more convenient, healthy, an every way desirable
station could not have been selected. The
immigrants are brought here directly from immigrant
vessels, in tugs or barges, and received into
rooms properly heated, lighted, and ventilated.
Bath-rooms, lunch counters, with provisions at
reasonable prices, suitable sleeping quarters, and
other conveniences are all found within the building,
and are conducted under strict superintendence.
The names of such as have
money, letters, or friends awaiting them
are called out. Clerks stand ready to
write letters for them in any European language.
There are railway offices where tickets are sold
them by thoroughly responsible clerks, who can
talk with them in their native tongues. Responsible
brokers exchange their foreign coin and currency
at par market value. There is an employment
bureau to find work for those who do not
care to go any farther. A physician is in attendance,
and the sick are properly cared for in a temporary
hospital until they are transported to the
immigrant hospitals on Ward’s Island.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that about two-thirds of all
the foreign immigration to the United States land
at New York, it is, indeed, a noble institution that
meets these strangers with such generous provisions
for their wants. According to an article in
“The American Cyclopedia,” of the 5,033,392 immigrants
arriving at New York between May 5,
1847, and Jan. 1, 1873, for whom commutation
money was paid by the vessel-owners,
“all of whom received protection,
advice, and information from the
commissions, 1,465,579 were provided and cared
for out of the immigrant fund, for a greater or less
period during the five years subsequent to their
arrival; 398,643 received treatment and care in
the institutions of the commissioners; 449,275
were temporarily supplied with board and lodging
and money relief in the city of New York; 349,936
were provided with employment through the
labor bureau at Castle Garden; 53,083 were forwarded
from Castle Garden to their destination
in the United States, or returned to Europe at
their own request; and 214,642 were relieved and
provided for in various parts of the State of New
York,” all out of this immigrant fund. In 1872-3
bills were introduced into Congress to supersede
this New York Emigration Commission by a National
bureau, but the movement excited great
opposition, not only in New York, but in other
quarters, and it ended in failure.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">DERIVATION OF SIRLOIN.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Galena</span>, Ill.<br>
</p>

<p>Is it true that an English king knighted a roast of
beef as Sir Loin, and that this was the origin of the
name sirloin for a certain cut of meat?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It is true that the great lexicographer,
Dr. Johnson, gave credence and currency to this
etymological nonsense, and that subsequent lexicographers,
down to Webster and Worcester,
parrot-like repeated it. But both of our distinguished
lexicographers rejected this popular
tradition of a silly freak or pun of James I. or
Charles II. as of no etymological value, and agree
that sirloin, which appears in Johnson’s dictionary
for the first time with this orthography, is
derived from the French surlonge, that is, “upper
loin.” In the old English dictionaries, such as
Ainsworth’s and Cotgrave’s, the English word was
spelled surloin, and both Webster and Worcester,
while giving sirloin as the usual orthography,
recommend surloin, and authorize it as the
preferable spelling. Skeats’ Etymological Dictionary,
Oxford, 1882, vocabulates this word
thus: “Sirloin, an inferior spelling of surloin, q.
v.;” and under surloin says: “Frequently spelled
sirloin, owing to a fable that the loin of beef was
knighted by one of our kings in a fit of good
humor.” The king was naturally imagined to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
the merry monarch Charles II., though Richardson
says (on no authority) that it was so entitled
by King James I. Both stories are discredited by
the use of the original French surlonge in the
fourteenth century. Indeed, Wedgewood actually
cites ‘a surloyn of beef’ from an account of expenses
of Henry VI. But Richardson had the
authority of Dean Swift for referring the pun on
surloin to James I. In “Polite Conversation”
Swift says: “But, pray, why is it called a sirloin?
Why, you must know that our King James I., who
loved good eating, being invited to dinner by one
of his nobles, and seeing a large loin of beef at
his table, he drew out his sword and in a frolic
knighted it.” Which Swift, in all probability, intended
to be taken as a legend, and nothing
more.</p>

mining for the precious metals in North Carolina.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Malcolm McManus.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There was a time when gold mining
in North Carolina was an important industry.
The earliest record at the United States mint of
gold produced in this country was in 1804. In
that year a deposit was made at the mint of gold
found in North Carolina. Small amounts, not exceeding
an annual average of $2,500, were received
from 1804 to 1823, after which there was
a steady increase, as follows: In 1824, total
amount received at mint, $5,000; in 1825,
$17,000; in 1826, $20,000; in 1827, $21,000;
in 1828, $46,000; in 1829, $134,000. During
this last year $2,500 was received from Virginia
and $3,500 from South Carolina. A Southern
“gold fever” set in, and hundreds of people
went to prospecting all along the Appalachian
Mountains, so that in the next year,
1830, the mint received $212,000 from
Georgia, $204,000 from North Carolina, $26,000
from South Carolina, $24,000 from Virginia, and
$2,000 from Tennessee and Alabama. The total
amounts of precious metals from the mines of the
South, deposited at the United States mint from
1804 to 1881, was as follows:</p>

<p>Various causes conduced to the decrease of
mining in the South before the discovery of gold
in California, but this latter event drew away the
best miners and most experienced, most enterprising
capitalists engaged in the business, so
that the gold product of this region became insignificant.
A revival of mining has set in in North
Carolina, yet the products of the Carolinas and
Georgia in 1881 was only about $275,000.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—In the constitutional convention of
1787 Mr. Pierce Butler, a delegate from South
Carolina, moved the adoption of clause 3, section
2, article 4 of the Constitution, which reads: “No
person held to service or labor in one State, under
the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in
consequence of any law or regulation therein, be
discharged from such service or labor, but shall
be delivered up on claim of the party to whom
such service or labor may be due.” The first law
to give effect to this constitutional provision was
prepared by a committee of the Senate appointed
in November, 1792. This committee was composed
of Mr. Johnston, of North Carolina; Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Cabot, of Massachusetts, and Mr. Read,
of Delaware. In December Mr. Johnston
reported a bill which was not entirely satisfactory.
Mr. Taylor, of Virginia, and Mr. Sherman,
of Connecticut, were added to the committee. On
Jan. 3, 1793, Mr. Johnston reported a bill, which,
after several days’ consideration, was passed
without a single dissenting voice. On the 4th of
February following, this bill passed the House by
a vote of 48 to 7. We cannot give the text of it,
but it gave slave-masters and their agents
summary power to seize, hold, and return fugitives
from slavery to their former bondage, whatever
laws the States in which they were found
might pass to the contrary, the matter being one
under jurisdiction of the United States courts.</p>

<p>Where are the principal tin mines, and of what is
this metal composed?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Jonathan Trexlar.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Pure tin is an elementary metal, as
much so as lead, iron, silver, or gold. The principal
tin-producing country is England. The Phœnicians
traded with England for tin 1,100 years
before the Christian era. There is reason to believe
that they got tin from Spain also; but England
was depended on for nearly all the tin used in
Europe until this ore was discovered in Germany
in 1240. It was discovered in Northern Africa,
in the Barbary States, in 1640; in India in 1740;
in New Spain in 1782. Tin was mined in Mexico
before the Spanish conquest, and used in T shaped
pieces for money, and in a bronze composition
for sharp tools; the principal mines being at
Tasco. Peru has valuable mines of this
metal, so have New South Wales, Australia,
and Banca, and Malacca in the
Malay peninsula. Tin has been discovered
in Pennsylvania, Missouri, California, and other
States of the Union, but not in quantities to
tempt capital to engage in mining it. The chief
tin-producing countries are the following, arranged
in the order of importance: England,
about 10,000 tons a year; Malacca, about 8,500
tons; Australia, about 6,000 tons; Banca, about
4,000 tons, and Billiton, about 3,000 tons. Both
of these last-named places are islands of the
Dutch East Indies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="smcap">O’Kane</span>, Neb.<br>
</p>

<p>Why was not zero on thermometers placed at the
freezing point instead of 32 degrees below?</p>

<p class="right">
M.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Zero is placed at freezing point on
some thermometers, although this is not the case
on the Fahrenheit scale, the one in common use
in England and the United States. When Fahrenheit
graded his thermometer he supposed that
there was no greater degree of cold than had been
observed in Iceland, or discovered by experimenting
with freezing mixtures. This point he marked
zero; i. e., empty or nought, as denoting the absence
of all heat. It is 32 degrees below freezing,
and corresponds to the cold produced by a freezing
mixture composed of snow and salt, or sal-ammoniac;
from which it has been inferred
that this was the test
used by Fahrenheit, the instrument-maker
of Amsterdam, who introduced this scale into
common use, and after whom it is named, but
who never actually divulged the secret of his process.
It is now known that this is an arbitrary
point, far above the lowest temperature in the
polar regions and several hundred degrees above
the greatest cold produced by artificial methods.
In the Reaumer thermometer, generally used in
Germany, and the Centigrade thermometer, commonly
used in France and by scientists of all nations,
zero marks the freezing point of distilled
water at the sea level, or under an atmospheric
pressure of 14.73 pounds to the square inch. To
reduce Fahrenheit to Centigrade, subtract 32
and multiply by 100/180, or 5/9. Conversely, to
reduce Centigrade to Fahrenheit, multiply by
9/5 and add 32.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—In 1776 South Carolina, in a Constitutional

republic, and soon after Rutledge was
made President and Commander-in-chief of the
State forces. He held this office until 1778, when

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Falconry, or hawking, was a favorite
sport with the nobility and gentry of Europe
down to the first half of the seventeenth century,
when the introduction of fowling pieces of a
light and elegant pattern and the art of shooting
flying gradually replaced it. Hawks were
trained to mount and pursue game and bring it
to their masters and mistresses, coming
and going at the call of the latter with
marvelous docility. The hawks were tricked
out with gay hoods and held until
ordered to pursue “the quarry,” or game, by
leathern straps fastened with rings of leather
around each leg, just above the talons, and silken
cords called “jesses.” To each of these leathern
straps, or “bewets,” was attached a small bell,
shaped in most cases like the nearly closed sleigh
bells of the present time. In a flight of hawks it
was often so arranged that the different bells
made “a consort of sweet sounds.” Bells of this
description, but of the cheapest kind, were
among the most popular trinkets used by the
early explorers and traders in bartering with the
natives of America.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Yes, unless we take into account the
pigmy republics, or semi-republics, of San Marino
and Andorra, the former a rough, craggy mountain
among the Appenines, with a total area of 21
square miles and a total population of 7,816 persons,
and the latter an isolated valley in the Eastern
Pyrenees, shut in between the two great, jealous
powers, France and Spain, with an area of
about 300 square miles, and a population variously
estimated at from 4,000 to 12,000.
Andorra is governed by “the Sovereign Council”
of twenty-four members, which elects one of its
members to be Syndic for life, the chief executive
of the State. San Marino is governed by
“the Sovereign Grand Council,” composed of
sixty members, of whom one-third are nobles.
There are two heads of this mammoth republic,
called, “Captains Regent,” one chosen from the
nobles and the other from the “bourgeoisie,” or
common people, each holding office for only six

cost, and particulars of the calamity?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">C. N. Warren.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The enormous but ill-constructed
bridge across the Tay at Dundee, Scotland,
was authorized by an act passed in
1870. Work was begun in June, 1871.
It was much injured by a gale Feb. 4, 1877, but
was pushed forward and declared to be completed
Aug. 30, 1877. It was tried on the 25th
of the following month, and opened for business
on May 31, 1878. Twenty lives were lost in its
construction, and it cost £350,000, or about $1,750,000.
It was 10,612 feet long, and rested on
85 spans, some of which were 90 feet above
low tide. At about 7:15 p. m. on Dec. 28, 1879,
less than seventeen months after it was first
opened to traffic—while a North British mail train
was crossing in the midst of a fierce gale—the
structure gave way, leaving a gap of 3,000 feet.
The train plunged into the surging sea, and not
one of the ill-fated passengers escaped. There
were between 75 and 90 persons on board; exactly
how many was never ascertained. Forty-six
bodies were recovered up to April 27, 1880.
After the official inquiry Mr. H. C. Rothery declared
that “the bridge had been badly planned,
badly constructed, and badly maintained.” A
new bridge, of a much more substantial character,
is now in process of construction.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Soldiers now in the regular army
may perform certain preliminary acts relating to
homestead entries, but they cannot perfect title
to such land until their terms of service have expired.
See instructions in “Copp’s Land Owner,”
vol. 2, p. 133, and case of Charles Harris, “Land
Owner,” vol. 6, p. 190. The soldier or his family
must reside on the land at least one year, under

<p><em>Answer.</em>—According to the “American Almanac,”
which in turn refers to the famous “Bevolkerung
der Erde,” of Gotha, edited by Messrs. Behm &amp;
Wagner, the population of Peking in 1880 was
500,000. Until within a comparatively recent
date the estimates of the population of that city
never ranged below 1,000,000. Cyclopedias generally
estimated it at 1,500,000, and some of them
as high as 2,000,000. Messrs. Behm &amp; Wagner
have carefully revised their former statistics of
China, and have reduced their estimate of the
total population of the country fully 55,000,000.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>

<p>A Jewish gentleman and myself have had an argument,
he asserting that Hebrew is a spoken language
at the present time. I am of the impression that
Hebrew ceased to be a spoken language during the
seventy years’ captivity in Babylon, while he declares
that he has seen a Jew, directly from Jerusalem, who
could talk nothing but Hebrew. Can you give us any
light on this subject?</p>

<p class="right">
H. H. J.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Hebrew, like Latin and classic Greek,
is a literary, and not a colloquial language. The
precise time when Hebrew ceased to be the living,
vernacular language of the Jews is not known.
Some learned Hebraists maintain that they lost the
living use of the Hebrew during the Babylonish
captivity, but the weight of argument is in favor
of the belief that they retained the partial use of
it for some time after their return to Palestine,
and lost it by degrees. No decisive evidence,
however, shows exactly when it became
a virtually dead language; although there are
satisfactory reasons for declaring that it gave
place to a corrupted form of the Aramaic language,
a mixture of Syrian and Chaldean or Babylonish
speech called the Syro-Chaldaic dialect,
several hundred years before the Christian era,
and that more than a century before this era it
ceased to be used even as a written language and
was thenceforth studied only as the language of
the sacred books, by the learned.</p>

<span class="smcap">Old Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—According to “Copp’s Public Land

“a settler relinquishing or abandoning his
claim cannot thereafter make a second entry; but
where an entry is canceled as invalid for some
reason other than abandonment, and not the wilful
act of the party, he is not thereby debarred

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Probably all the States have pharmacy
laws; that is, laws regulating the compounding
and sale of drugs, but these are loosely
administered in most States, the laws themselves
being radically defective. Most prescription clerks
pick up their knowledge of pharmacy between errands
and “by practice,” as it is called, without
even an elementary knowledge of chemistry or
any systematic course of training. There are in
all fourteen schools of pharmacy in the United
States; 1 in San Francisco, 1 in Chicago, 1 in
Louisville, 1 in New Orleans, 1 in Baltimore, 1 in
Boston, 1 in Ann Arbor, Mich., 1 in St. Louis, 2
in New York City, 1 in Cincinnati, 1 in Philadelphia,
1 in Pittsburg, 1 in Nashville, and 1 in
Washington. All told, they had only 1,347 students
in 1880, of whom they graduated but 186.
There are 284 retail drug stores in Chicago, and
it is estimated that there are more than 1,600 in
the State and about 25,600 such stores in the
United States with twice that number of persons
compounding medicines; so that it is a clear case
that comparatively few druggists and prescription

<p>Be so good as to define the word “agnosticism,” as

have examined several dictionaries and one encyclopedia,
and have failed to find the word.</p>

<p class="right">
E. J. A.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Agnosticism is a sort of supernatural
knownothingism. It is true that this word is not
defined in either Webster’s or Worcester’s unabridged
dictionaries, except in the supplements
to the latest editions, and does not appear in the
regular order of subjects in the popular encyclopedias.
It is derived from a Greek word that
signifies “to know not.” Agnosticism then, as
used by Herbert Spencer and his disciples, is the
doctrine that, professing ignorance of the supernatural,
neither asserts nor denies the existence
of a personal Deity, and claims that such doctrine
can be neither proved nor disapproved, because of
the insufficiency of the evidence furnished
by rational and material nature to
warrant a positive conclusion: or, as
others say, because of the necessary limits of the
human mind. Agnosticism is opposed both to
the positive assertion of the skeptic, who denies
the existence of a personal God, and the opposite
declaration of the Christian church, or dogmatic
theism, affirming such existence.</p>

as the result, which I considered extremely satisfactory.
About the 10th of July I made another
trial, using this time eleven dozen of eggs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
the result was 87 per cent of chicks. About 6 per
cent of the eggs from these two trials which did
not hatch were found on examination to be unfertile,
leaving 7 per cent with dead chicks in the
various stages of maturity. These two trials
proved satisfactory, even beyond my most sanguine
expectations. On the 15th of January I procured
204 eggs from the farmers, and placed them
in the incubator for my third trial, but, owing to
the extremely cold weather during the time the
eggs were laid, they had become chilled before
being gathered, and, as the result, I only succeeded
in getting forty chicks, or a little less than
20 per cent. To avoid a second failure, I determined
to wait until the cold weather was over
before securing eggs for my next hatching.</p>

</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Mr. P. P. Bliss, the popular composer
of sacred lyrics, and evangelistic vocalist, perished
at Ashtabula, Ohio, in the terrible railroad
disaster consequent on the fall of the Ashtabula
bridge on the night of Dec. 29, 1876. Two engines
and eleven cars, with about 160 passengers, were
precipitated into the creek, seventy feet below.
The wreck immediately took fire, and before
help could reach the scene more
than a hundred persons had perished through the
fall or the flames, or were so badly injured that
they afterward died. A terrible snowstorm and
intense cold added to the sufferings of the survivors.
In the midst of this scene of horror and
distraction Mr. Bliss and his wife both lost their
lives. It is by no means certain that Mr. Bliss
could have escaped if he had abandoned his wife.
If he could have done so, but perished in the effort
to rescue her, such an act was heroic, and
none but an idiot would class him with suicides.</p>

about one-third, had been surveyed up to June
30, 1882, and a considerable part of this third is
still open to purchase or entry under the general

California, Oregon, and Nevada there are great
areas of timber and stone lands for sale under the
law of June 3, 1878, at $2.50 per acre. The
“Desert Lands Act” of March 3, 1877, provides
for the sale of certain lands which can be cultivated
only by artificial irrigation, at 25 cents
an acre. After deducting these tracts, mineral
lands, coal lands, and saline lands, there are still
millions of acres of lands in Washington Territory

adapted to agriculture and grazing.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Jane Evans.</span><br>

<p><em>Answer.</em>.—There was no permanent seat of government.
The articles of confederation provided
that “Congress shall have power to adjourn at any
time within the year and to any place within the
United States, so that no period of adjournment
be for a longer duration than the space of six
months.” When suffered to have its own way
Congress sat, during the war, in Philadelphia, but
the “red coats” were as keen to go to Congress as
the average modern politician, and the patriots, to
avoid a row over contested seats, adopted a sort
of methodistic itinerancy, minus the method.
Congress was in session at Philadelphia in December,
1776, when, seeing that the British were
likely to force themselves upon the hospitality
of that city, it adjourned to Baltimore.
It returned to Philadelphia, but after the
American defeat at Brandywine, Sept. 11, 1777,
it adjourned to Lancaster, and then to York, Pa.
From the first session to the last the Continental
Congress met as follows: At Philadelphia, Sept.
5, 1774, and May 10, 1775; at Baltimore, Dec.
20, 1776; at Philadelphia, March 4, 1777; at
Lancaster, Pa., Sept. 27, 1777; at York, Pa., Sept.
30, 1777; at Philadelphia, July 2, 1778; at
Princeton, N. J., June 30, 1783; at Annapolis,
Md., Nov. 26, 1783; at Trenton, N. J., Nov. 1,
1784; at New York, Jan. 11, 1785, which continued
to be the seat of Congress until the adoption
of the Constitution of the United
States. There was no executive head of
the United States under the articles of
confederation. These provided that Congress
should have authority to appoint a “Committee
of the States,” to consist of one delegate from
each State, to sit in the recess of Congress. The
President of Congress came the nearest to being
an executive chief, but he and the above committee,
the “Board of War,” and certain other special
committees or boards were each charged with the

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Byron.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>.—Article 4, section 1, clause 1, of the
Constitution of the United States declares that
“No new State shall be formed or erected within
the jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State
be formed by the junction of two or more States,
without the consent of the Legislatures of the
States concerned as well as of the Congress.”
The erecting of West Virginia into a State was an
incident of the late war. While the convention
in session at Richmond resolved to take Virginia
out of the Union, the Unionists of West Virginia
called a convention that assembled at Wheeling
May 13, 1861, composed of delegates from
twenty-five western counties of the State. This
convention passed resolutions denouncing secession
and providing for a convention of all the
counties of Virginia adhering to the National
Government. Delegates representing forty counties
convened in Wheeling on June 11, repudiated
the acts of the rebel convention, and on June
20 elected Francis H. Pierpont Governor of what
they denominated the “reorganized State of Virginia.”
A Legislature was elected, which met in
Wheeling on July 2. This body elected two
United States Senators to take the place of the
Virginia Senators which had gone over to the
Confederacy. It also provided for an election, to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
held on the 24th of the following October, to decide
upon the formation of a new State, the eastern
part of the State being in possession of the
rebels. The people, by a large majority, declared
in favor of a new State, and, at the same time,
chose delegates to a convention to meet at Wheeling
Nov. 24, which convention framed a
State Constitution, which was ratified by the
people May 3, 1862. May 13 the Legislature—which
claimed, it must be remembered, to represent
the whole State of Virginia, as it certainly
did represent all the loyal part—approved the
formation of the new State under the name of
West Virginia, and Dec. 31, 1862, provided for
its admission to the Union. It was held by distinguished

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">R. E. Glover.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Mason and Dixon’s line is the concurrent
State line of Maryland and Pennsylvania.
It is named after two eminent astronomers and
mathematicians, Charles Mason and Jeremiah
Dixon, who were sent out from England to run it.
They completed the survey between 1763 and
1767, excepting thirty-six miles surveyed in 1782
by Colonel Alex. McLean and Joseph Neville. It
is in the latitude of 39 deg. 43 min. 26.3 sec.
Missouri was admitted to the Union only after a
long protracted and violent discussion, growing
out of a provision in the State constitution sanctioning
slavery. A compromise was finally effected
by which the new State was admitted
with slavery, with a solemn agreement that
there should be no more slave States formed
out of territory north of the parallel of 36 deg.
30 min., the southern boundary of Missouri. In
political discussions Mason and Dixon’s line was
understood to mean both of the above lines and
the Ohio River, or, in other words, the boundary
between free and slave territory the country
through. When Kansas was thrown open to settlement
the Southerners were determined, despite
the Missouri compromise, to try to make
Kansas a slave State. Their Representatives in
Congress, with the exception of a few Whigs,
united in favor of a repeal of the compromise.
With the help of the Douglas Democrats in the
North and several pro-slavery Whigs, they carried
their point. The consequence was the
bloody struggles between the free-State and pro-slavery
men in the early history of Kansas,
which was practically the inauguration of the
war of the rebellion, although the latter did not
burst into full flame until after the election of
President Lincoln and the secession of the Southern
States.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—First, they are generally boiled for
the oil and glue or gelatine in them, which do not
materially affect their value as fertilizers. They are
then ground or crushed, without being previously
burned. In this state this fertilizer is known as
bone dust, and is sown broadcast at the rate of
50 to 100 pounds to the acre, as a rich manure
for pasture, turnips, and small grain lands. In
Cheshire, England, where the fine red sandstone
loam had become comparatively sterile before the
first of this century, through deficiency of phosphoric
acid in the soil, caused by constant pasturage
in dairy farming, they resorted to the use
of calcined bone and bone dust, with the effect of
doubling the product the first year. There they
often lay on a half ton to a ton to an acre, which
serves as a good dressing for sixteen to twenty
years. The best way to ascertain whether a soil
needs bone dust is to experiment for a year or two
with a small plat of ground. The result will determine
better than a chemical analysis whether
a bone dust dressing will pay.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Cabez de Vaca, a Spanish adventurer,
was in New Mexico with his shipwrecked

a large military expedition, conquered the Zuni
and Moqui towns, or pueblos, in 1540-41, and
kept a journal, still in existence, which identifies
the regions he overran as undoubtedly a part of
this Territory. Don Antonio Espejo left Zacatecas
in 1581 according to some authorities, but
late in 1582 according to others, and visited what
is now Santa Fe County, New Mexico, in July
of 1583. He gave a fuller report than had ever
been given before of the pueblos of this region,
in which he estimated the population of the
province of Taos as 40,000. The principal pueblo
in this province was Tanos, afterward known as
Tegra, and still later as Santa Fe. As an Indian

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">V. H. Lucas.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—By a treaty made with certain chiefs
of the Sacs and Foxes at St. Louis in 1804, the
Indians ceded all their lands in Illinois to the
United States for the paltry annuity of $1,000
and goods to the value of $2,234.50. In a treaty
made in 1822, covering various matters, a clause
was introduced confirming the cession of 1804.
Still the government did not demand actual possession
of these lands. In 1830, Keokuk, Black
Hawk’s rival, negotiated a treaty in which the
government recognized him as the head chief of the
Sacs and Foxes, and in which he clearly ceded all
the lands in question. Black Hawk, who had always
opposed any cession of territory to the whites,
was not present at this convention, and he and
his followers, constituting a minority of the tribe,
but really representing the portion most concerned,
the actual occupants of the great village
at Rock Island, protested against the validity of
this and the previous cessions. Black Hawk declared
that the treaty of 1804 was made by only
four chiefs, that they signed it under the influence
of liquor, and had never been authorized by
the tribe to cede lands. It was not so easy to explain
away the clause in the treaty of 1822, but
he characterized it also as a fraud, signed without
full understanding of its intent. As to the convention
of 1830, he denied the authority of Keokuk’s
band to deed away the lands east of the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>Returning in April, 1831, from the winter’s
hunt in the North, Black Hawk’s band
found that their chief’s former friend, an
Indian fur-trader at Rock Island, had purchased
of the government the ground on
which this ancient village stood, in the forks of
the Mississippi and Rock River, and with his associate
speculators were preparing to cultivate
the Indian field of some 700 acres adjoining the
village. It seems marvelous that Black Hawk
could so far restrain his people as to persuade
them to submit to a compromise by which
they yielded possession of half this field for the
season to the speculators. But the latter were
not satisfied, and both parties soon grew irritated.
Governor Reynolds, of this State, was asked to
interfere. Soon after the militia were called out.
On the 7th of June General Gaines, of the regular
army, commanding at Fort Armstrong, on Rock
Island, summoned the Indians to a council, when
he commanded them to leave the east side of the
Mississippi. Black Hawk refused; but as the
State militia, to the number of about 1,600, under
command of General Joseph Duncan, drew
near, he saw that his few hundred warriors would
be overwhelmed, and on June 24, during the
night, the Indians deserted their village, which the
Americans a few days later utterly destroyed. On
June 30, Black Hawk and his party signed a treaty
by which for the first time he individually joined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
in the relinquishment of the lands in dispute.
The next winter found him and his band in a
destitute, starving condition, owing to their being
driven from their cornfields at a season when
it was too late to plant elsewhere. In the spring,
in defiance of the treaty, he and 368 warriors
with their families, crossed the Mississippi and
passed up Rock River, to plant corn, as they said,
in the Winnebago country, in Southern Wisconsin.
General Atkinson, in command of the regular
troops at Fort Armstrong, warned them to
return. Governor Reynolds again called out the
militia, and placed them under command of General
Samuel Whiteside. Nothing serious occurred
until the 14th of May, when the rash conduct of
a party of 275 volunteers under Major Stillman
provoked a fight with some sixty of Black Hawk’s
warriors, near the mouth of the Kishwaukee
a few miles south of Rockford. The whites were
panicstricken and fled with the loss of eleven
men. So slow had been the movement of the
militia that already their time of enlistment
had nearly expired, and, not liking this taste of
Indian war, they became mutinous, and had to be
discharged. General Atkinson could do little
with his mere handful of regular troops, so he
intrenched his company at Dixon and remained
there, while Black Hawk’s followers, re-enforced
by a few Winnebago, Ottawa and Pottawatomie
braves, roamed over the country committing outrages
on defenceless settlers, a number of whom
were killed. Affairs grew serious. Governor
Reynolds called for 2,000 militia.
In July the regulars and militia, all under the
chief command of General Atkinson, drove Black
Hawk up Rock River and across to the Wisconsin
River, where General James D. Henry, the chief
hero of this war, in command of a brigade of Illinois
militia, overtook him at Wisconsin Heights,
and inflicted the first serious punishment the Indians
had suffered. Over fifty warriors were
killed, and the entire body of them was badly demoralized.
Escaping across the Wisconsin
with great loss, they fled, leaving their
dead and dying, and abandoned articles along
their trail. The whole army followed in hot pursuit,
and on Aug. 2, General Henry again struck
their main force and drove them into the Mississippi
at the mouth of the Bad Axe. Here the
regulars and the rest of the army joining in,
soon cut them to pieces. General Winfield Scott
took command five days later, on Aug. 7, 1831,
and not long afterwards negotiated a treaty of
peace. Black Hawk and two of his sons, with
several of his principal warriors, were held as
hostages for a time. After detention at Fortress
Monroe until June 5 of the next year, he was released.
During his captivity he was taken to all
the principal cities, where his fate elicited a good
deal of sympathy. After his return he lived
peaceably with his tribe in Iowa until his death,
Oct. 3, 1838, in the 70th year of his age. He was
buried at Iowaville, Iowa.</p>

Company, sixty of whom, led by Henry
More, and followed by fugitives from the civil

the soil, which soon yielded rich crops of tobacco.
Later the salt lagoons furnished the chief article

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">John Martin.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Alexander Sullivan shot Francis
Hanford, Principal of the North Side High
School, Chicago, on Aug. 7, 1876, under the following
circumstances: In an anonymous paper
read that afternoon in the City Council it was
charged that Mrs. Alexander Sullivan had procured
the appointment of her husband, as Secretary
of the Board of Public Works, through undue
influence over Mayor Colvin. It was also charged
that she was the moving spirit in a corrupt ring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
that dictated the management of the public
schools. Mr. Sullivan was told that
the author of this paper was Mr. Hanford.
At 7 o’clock that same evening, himself, wife and
a younger brother drove up in front of the Hanford
residence as that gentleman was sprinkling
his grass plat, while Mrs. Hanford sat on the
door-step looking on. Sullivan demanded an immediate
retraction; after a few words he knocked
Mr. Hanford down. A scuffle ensued which ended
in Sullivan’s drawing a revolver and shooting
Mr. Hanford dead in the presence of his family.
He afterward claimed that during the fracas,
when Mrs. Sullivan came up to separate them
Mr. Hanford had struck her. On the trial the
prosecution claimed that if this were so, the
blow was not directed or intended for Mrs. Sullivan,
but came about in Mr. Hanford’s efforts to
protect himself from Sullivan’s attack. The first
trial of Sullivan began Oct. 17, 1876, and ended
Oct. 27 in a disagreement of the jury. The public
was greatly exasperated, and, believing that the
disagreement of the jury was due to the rulings
and charge of Judge McAllister, there was a loud
call made by the most respectable citizens
of all classes for his resignation.
When the news reached the Board
of Trade such a scene was witnessed as seldom
occurs in such a place. By unanimous consent all
business was suspended. In ten minutes a petition
was prepared, asking Judge McAllister to resign
at once. In half an hour it had received 500
signatures, and by night there were 1,200 names
appended, all of members of the board. The
Judge treated this petition and the unanimous
condemnation of the press with silent contempt.
Sullivan’s second trial opened Feb. 26, 1877, before
the same judge, and closed March 9 with a
verdict of acquittal. Judge McAllister was never
impeached before any legal tribunal; but at the
bar of public opinion he suffered the condemnation
of the intelligent, order-loving element of the
entire country. This Alexander Sullivan is now
the President of the newly organized Irish National
League of America.</p>

the bonds thus deposited falls below the amount
of the circulation issued for the same, he is authorized
to demand additional security in United
States bonds or money to the amount of such depreciation.
National bank notes are all printed
by the government, and furnished to the banks
only in such quantities as they are authorized to
circulate. As a consequence there can be no
over issues. In case of the failure of a bank to
redeem its circulating notes, the holders may
present them for payment at the Treasury
of the United States, where they
will be redeemed. The government is protected
against loss by holding a first lien on all the
assets of such banks. Depositors in cases of
failure do not always realize the full amount of
their claims, but the history of banking shows no
parallel to the excellence of this system in respect
of the small proportion of loss suffered by
depositors. The loss to all creditors of the United
States National banks from the passage of the act
of Feb. 25, 1863, to Nov. 1, 1882, amounted to
only about $400,000 per annum on an average
capital of $450,000,000, and annual deposits
averaging $800,000,000, so that the average loss
to depositors during a period of nearly twenty
years was but one-twentieth of 1 per cent per
annum.</p>

a State, in 1821, Iowa was left without any
civil government. From 1834 to 1836 it was attached
to Michigan Territory, then embracing
Wisconsin, Stevens T. Mason, Governor. In 1836
Wisconsin Territory was organized, including
Iowa, and the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature
was actually in session at Burlington, Iowa, when
news came from Washington that Iowa had been
constituted a separate Territory. Of course there

<p>Please explain how steel rails are made.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Alpha.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Steel is a carburet of iron, rendered
as free as possible of all foreign matter, such as
sulphur, phosphorus, etc. It may be produced by
working pig iron, which contains 4 or 5 per cent
of carbon, in a suitable furnace until the amount
of carbon is reduced to about 1 per cent, the average
carbon in good steel. This is a decarbonizing
process. In the other process, which is
directly opposite to this, iron bars, freed of carbon,
are heated in contact with charcoal until
they have absorbed the necessary per cent of carbon.
The steel, in the form of ingots, is brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
to a proper heat and welded together in proper
quantity to make a rail of given length and
weight. This is then rolled into proper shape by
immense rollers, grooved so as to give the right
shape to the rail. Bessemer steel rails can be cast
in molds.</p>

search for gold, but failing to discover any they
built a rude ship and put to sea in it. In 1650 a
settlement was started upon the Chowan River
by emigrants from Virginia and England, which
was afterward called Albemarle County Colony,
and another settlement near Wilmington, made
by planters from Barbadoes, was named Clarendon
County Colony. In 1670 a colony settled
upon the banks of the Ashley River, but ten years

This is often called a “Congressional township,”
sometimes a “government township.” Along the

particularly next to State boundaries, fractional
Congressional townships are common. For purposes
of township government, fractional townships
are in many cases united with adjoining
townships, or two full townships may be joined
under one town organization. In other cases three
or more Congressional townships organize under
one or two political town governments, according
to the convenience and wishes of a majority
of the inhabitants. 2. For an explanation of the

<p class="right">

<p><em>Answer.</em>—1. The following are the rules governing
the State inspection of barley in Chicago:
“No. 1 barley shall be plump, bright, clean, and
free from other grain. No. 2 barley shall be
sound, of healthy color, bright or but slightly
stained, not plump enough for No. 1, reasonably
clean, and reasonably free from other grain. No.
3 barley shall include slightly shrunken and
otherwise slightly damaged barley, not good
enough for No. 2. No. 4 barley shall include all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
barley fit for malting purposes, not good enough
for No. 3. No. 5 barley shall include all barley
which is badly damaged, or for any cause unfit
for malting purposes, except that barley which
has been chemically heated shall not be graded
at all.” 2. The color of barley is an indication of
its age and condition in several respects. 3. The
legal bushel by weight is different
in different States. In California
and Nevada it is 50 pounds; in Wisconsin and
most other States it is 48; in Pennsylvania, 47;
in Oregon, 46; in Louisiana it is only 32. Boards
of trade make rules for themselves, one object
being uniformity for the whole country. 4. As a
rule, statutes fixing the weight per bushel of various
commodities specify that this is to apply
only in cases where contracts fail to specify the
weight to be given. When grain is sold on
’Change the rules of the board determine the
weight to be delivered. Since seller and purchaser
are presumed to be acquainted with these
rules, it is hard to imagine how either can justly
complain of being “gouged.”</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Herodotus, called the “Father of History,”
was born at Halicarnassus, a Dorian city of
Asia Minor, B. C. 484. In his youth he became
disgusted with the tyrannical rule of Lygdamis,
and abandoned his home for the island of Samos,
upon which he acquired the Ionic dialect, which
he used in writing his history. After remaining
there some time he began his famous travels,
visiting Greece, Asia Minor, Syria, Babylon, and
Northern Africa. Returning to his old home he
assisted in the expulsion of Lygdamis and the
establishment of a new ruler. The latter, however,
became nearly as tyrannical as the former,
so that Herodotus again looked abroad for a
home. Hearing that a colony was about to leave
Athens for Italy, he joined it and settled, B. C.
443, at Thurrii in that peninsula. At that place
he lived the remainder of his life, writing the history
which has been a lasting monument to his
name. It is not known in what year he died; but
it is supposed that he lived to be a very old man.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">J. Robinson.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Section 4,718 of the Revised Statutes

any person entitled to a pension, having an application
therefor pending, has died or shall hereafter
die, his widow, or if there is no widow, the
child or children of such person under the age of
16 years shall be entitled to receive the accrued
pension to the date of the death of such person.
Such accrued pension shall not be considered as a
part of the assets of the estate of deceased nor
liable to be applied to the payment of the debts of
the said estate in any case whatever, but shall
inure to the sole and exclusive benefit of the
widow or children; and if no widow or child survive
no payment whatsoever of accrued pension
shall be allowed, except so much as may be necessary
to reimburse the person who bore the
expenses of the last sickness and burial of the
decedent in cases where he did not have sufficient
assets to meet such expenses.” According to
Section 4,707 pensions may be granted to relatives

<p class="right">
E. B. T.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Colosseum, or Coliseum, as it is
sometimes spelled, was a colossal amphitheater
constructed by the Emperors Vespasian and
Titus. It was in the form of an oval, the longer
diameter being 612 feet, the shorter diameter 515
feet, and the height of the walls from 160 to 180
feet. It contained seats for 87,000 persons, and
standing room for 15,000 more. The arena, or
oval in the center, where the gladiators fought
and the deadly conflicts with wild beasts took
place, was 281 feet by 176. The walls were of
marble, the external face consisting of four
stages, or offsets, adorned with engaged
columns of the three orders of
Grecian architecture, Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian.
The lowest three were arcaded, having each
eighty columns and as many arches. Statues,
sculptures, figures of chariots, metal shields, and
other embellishments adorned the niches and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
salient points. What was the internal structure
of this vast building is not fully understood. The
tiers of seats above referred to only rose to one-half
the height of the stupendous walls. Whether
there were hanging galleries above these marble
seats is now only a matter of conjecture. Over
2,000 wild beasts were killed in the dedicatory
service. There were means by which, when the
combats were ended, the immense arena could be
filled with water for the exhibition of sea fights.
During the various persecutions of the early
Christians, many of these were thrown to the wild
beasts in this amphitheater. One of the first of
these was St. Ignatius, who was torn to pieces by
lions. In the sixth century, when Christianity
gained the ascendency, the church put an end to
the use of the Colosseum. It still stood entire in
the eighth century, but subsequently large quantities
of the marble was used in the construction of
public and private buildings. Pope Benedict XIV.,
in commemoration of the martyrs who had suffered
within its walls, consecrated the Colosseum
as a monument to them, erected crosses and
oratorios within it, and so put an end to the
process of destruction. Ever since it has been
regarded as sacred to the martyrs and subject to
the church.</p>

<p class="right">
H. E. T.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The ordinary means of lighting and
warming Esquimaux igloos, or winter huts, is a
large basin of oil furnished with moss wick.
These basins are scolloped from soapstone or
similar material. The oil is the product of the
whale, seal, or other fish, or of the white bear,
but usually the former. Igloos are huts usually
a half or more underground, and finished above
ground with stones, bones, turf, and moss, and
finally with ice and snow. Sometimes they are
constructed of blocks of ice and compact snow,
with transparent ice windows. The igloo is
reached by a long tunnel-like entrance, is unventilated,
and soon after the great lamp is lit the
heat from this and the warmth from the bodies of
the inmates render the mephitic air almost suffocating.
These people, generally, eat their food
raw or but half cooked.</p>

the origin and meaning of Gotham?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">J. C. Starr.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—In “Salmagundi,” a humorous
work written by Washington Irving, his brother
William, and James K. Paulding, this name is
applied to New York, to suit the purpose of the
authors in representing the inhabitants as given
to undue pretensions to wisdom. Of course, the
allusion is to the inhabitants of Gotham, a parish
in Nottinghamshire, England, who were as remarkable
for their stupidity as for their conceit.
All the follies of English wiseacres were attributed
to them. Fuller says: “The proverb of ‘as
wise as a man of Gotham’ passeth publicly for
the periphrasis of a fool; and a hundred fopperies
are forged and fathered on the townsfolk of
Gotham.” It was said that when King John was
about to pass through Gotham toward Nottingham
he was prevented by the inhabitants, who
thought that the ground over which a king
passed became forever a public road. When the
King sent to punish them they resorted to an expedient
to avert their sovereign’s wrath. According
to this, when the avengers arrived they found
the people each engaged in some foolish occupation
or other, so that the King’s messengers returned
to court and reported that Gotham was a
village of fools. In time a book appeared, entitled
“Certain Merry Tales of the Mad Men of
Gotham,” compiled in the reign of Henry VIII.,
by Andrew Borde, a sort of traveling quack, from
whom the occupation of the “Merry Andrew” is
said to be derived. Among these tales is the
story of “The Three Wise Men of Gotham,” who
went to sea in a bowl. The book had a wonderful
sale. Walpole attributed it to Lucas de Heere, a
Flemish painter, resident in England in the time

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The dimensions of St. Peter’s at
Rome, the largest cathedral in the world, are as
follows: Length of the interior, 613½ English
feet; of transept, 446½ feet; height of nave,
152½ feet; and the diameter of cupola, 193 feet.
The height of the dome from the pavement to the
top of the cross is 448 feet. Cologne cathedral is
511 feet long, and 231 feet broad. The towers
are 511 feet high. This famous building, founded
by Archbishop Conrad, designed by Architect
Gerhard von Riehl, and commenced Aug. 15,
1248, was not completed until Aug. 14, 1880. It
was solemnly opened with august ceremonies,
Oct. 15, of the same year.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">O. H. Baker.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Chess is such an ancient game that
its origin is unknown. Many of the most learned
Oriental scholars have written upon the subject,
appealing to history and philology to support
their theories. It has been ascribed to a Chinese
mandarin by the name of Han-Sing, who, it is
said, invented it as an amusement for his soldiers
when in winter quarters, about 174 B. C. They
call it “the play of the science of war.” Sir William
Jones, the great Sanscrit scholar, claimed
that Hindu traditions, the names of the pieces,
and other particulars indicate that chess was
played in India in the earliest times. He writes
that a learned Brahmin assured him that it was
mentioned in several of the oldest books of
India, where it was declared that it
was invented by the wife of one of the most ancient
kings of Ceylon to amuse that monarch
while Rama was besieging his metropolis. This,
by their reckoning, was 2,000 to 3,000 years
before the commencement of our era. On the
other hand, several later scholars of Sanscrit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
think it was invented in India by Buddhists
some time between the third and ninth centuries,
A. D., a theory inconsistent with the unwarlike
nature of Buddhism and the fact that the Hindu
name of the game, “chaturanga,” is a military
name, signifying the game of armies, corresponding
with the Chinese name for chess, given above.
Others have ascribed this game to the Babylonians,
Persians, Scythians, Egyptians, Jews,
Greeks, or Romans, according to their several
theories, but the weight of evidence is in favor of
its being of Indian or Chinese origin, and this is
now the generally accepted belief.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The act of Congress of February,
1882, provided for a reapportionment of the
membership of the House of Representatives,
based on the census of 1880, provided that in the
cases of States entitled under this apportionment
to additional representation, the additional members
in the Forty-eighth Congress might be
elected on a general State ticket; also, that in all
cases where the number of representatives was
reduced, as in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont,
the whole number for such State should be
elected at large, “unless the Legislatures of said
States have provided or shall provide before the
time fixed by law for the next election of Representatives
therein.” Kansas, for example, which
is entitled by this act to four additional representatives,
did not redistrict before the last Congressional
election, and so she elected four Congressmen
at large, viz., Edmund W. Morrill,
Lewis Hanback, Samuel R. Peters, and Bishop W.
Perkins. Maine did not redistrict, so all her representatives
were elected at large, instead of by

<p>Please give some facts as to the capacity of balloons;
what is used to fill them, and what are some of
the greatest balloon performances?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">L. J. Swartz.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The buoyancy of a balloon depends
on the weight of the gas with which it is inflated
compared with the weight of common air, bulk
for bulk. Hydrogen is the lightest of all known
substances. A cubic foot of atmospheric air at a
temperature of 34 degrees weighs 527.04 troy
grains, while a cubic foot of hydrogen is about
fourteen and a half times lighter than this. Coal
gas is about two and a half times lighter than
air. If a balloon would contain 1,000 pounds of
atmospheric air at temperature of 34 degrees
Fahrenheit, but filled with coal gas would weigh,
all told—covering, gas, and appendages—600
pounds, it would rise with a force equal to the
difference of these two numbers, or 400 pounds.
Mr. Glaisher, not long since, constructed a
balloon containing 90,000 cubic feet of coal gas,
that carried 600 pounds, and rose to the unsurpassed
height of 7½ miles, where the barometer,
which stands at about 30 at sea level, sank to
only 7 inches, showing an atmosphere of only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
about 22 per cent of the weight at sea level. The
longest balloon trip on record is that of the late
Professor J. Wise and Mr. La Mountain. Starting
from St. Louis for New York City, they traveled
1,150 miles in a little less than twenty
hours, when, being caught in a contrary current,
they were compelled to desist. Mr. Lowe’s mammoth
balloon was said to contain 700,000 cubic
feet of coal gas and have a lifting power of 22½
tons; but it was badly constructed and accomplished
nothing remarkable. In some 10,000 recorded
ascents made since the Montgolfiers invented
their famous balloons, just 100 years ago
this year, there have been but fifteen deaths
among 1,500 aeronauts; which indicates less
danger in this business than is generally supposed.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Jefferson Davis was born in Kentucky
in 1808; first became prominent in politics
as a member of the House of Representatives, and
later as Senator from Mississippi. He served in
the Mexican war, having been educated at West
Point. During President Pierce’s administration
Davis was Secretary of War, and was said to rule
both President and Cabinet. In 1857 he was returned
to the Senate, where he remained until
chosen President of the Confederacy in 1861.
This office he held for four years. In 1865, after
the fall of Richmond, Davis was captured and imprisoned
in Fortress Monroe for two years; was
released on bail in 1867, and finally liberated by
the general amnesty, Dec. 25, 1868. He is still
disqualified from holding any office of honor or

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">C. H. Cottle.</span><br>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Where large bodies of land are to be

President, describing the tracts, and specifying
the time and place of sale. When only a few isolated
tracts of land, not embraced in the regular
proclamations, are to be disposed of, notice is
given in a local newspaper. The land is then sold
to the highest bidder for cash only. Purchasers
are not compelled to reside on or cultivate such
lands. As the present policy of the government
is to encourage pre-emption and homestead settlement
and timber culture there are now few

<span class="smcap">S. C. Van Antwerp.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Maggie Mitchell, one of the best-known
of American actresses, was born in New
York City in 1832 of Scotch parents, in very
humble circumstances. When very young she
was employed in simple child parts in the
old Bowery Theater, for a pittance,
which went to help support
the family. When not more than 19 years of age,
she had advanced to playing parts of some importance,
and about this time, 1851, she made
her first appearance at Burton’s Theater as Julia,
in the “Soldier’s Daughter,” which was her first
capital success. Soon after this she went on a
“starring tour” that proved profitable and widely
extended her reputation. She made her first appearance
in Philadelphia at the Chestnut Street
Theater on March 20, 1854, as Constance in “The
Love Chase.” Up to 1862 Miss Mitchell was content
to appear in amusing characters, earning the
reputation of a clever comedienne, but about this
time she got hold of a clumsy, heavy dramatization
of George Sand’s popular novelette, “La
Petite Fadette.” She applied herself to the animating
and popularizing of this play, and the result
is her now famous drama “Fanchon,” many
of the most charming and pathetic parts being
entirely of her own creation. Since June 9,
1862, when she first produced “Fanchon” on the
stage at Laura Keene’s Theater, New York, it has
maintained a living interest which never
fails to draw a house. Other plays of her composition
or dramatization have followed, including
“Jane Eyre,” “The Pearl of Savoy,” and
“Mignon,” a stage rendering of an episode in
Goethe’s “Wilhelm Meister,” but none have
equaled, in popular esteem, Fanchon. Miss
Mitchell was married Oct. 15, 1868, to Henry
Paddock, of Cleveland, her present popular
stage manager. Although she is now 51 years of
age, she impersonates the girlish characters of her
repertory with all the sprightliness and youthful
vivacity that won the hearts of her auditors
twenty years ago.</p>

<p class="right">
C. P. B.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury,
the son of a Berkshire clothier, was born in
1573. He was ordained priest in 1601, and became
vicar of Stanford in 1607. From this position
he rose rapidly in power, by his executive
ability and manifestation of hatred of Puritanism,
until in 1628 he was appointed Bishop of
London. Early in his career he had won the
favor of the King, who thought he saw in him a
powerful advocate of the doctrine of the divine
right of kings, though Laud was really more interested
in maintaining the divine right of Episcopacy.
In 1617 he attempted, with the aid of
King James, to establish the Episcopacy in Scotland,
but in vain. In 1630 he was made Chancellor
of Oxford, the center of high-church loyalty,
and, according to the wish of his sovereign, attempted
to repress Puritanism by slitting noses,
clipping ears, fines, branding, and imprisonment.
In the high-commission and star-chamber courts
his power was almost absolute. But gradually he
won the bitterest hatred of the English people,
until in March, 1640, seven years after his
appointment to the Archbishopric of Canterbury,
he was imprisoned in the Tower
by order of the House of Commons. He was
brought to trial in the House of Lords, Nov. 13,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
1693, on charge of treason and other crimes, of
which they acquitted him; but they soon afterward
gave their assent to the ordinance for his
execution, passed by the Commons. He had
lived until the Puritans, whom he had despised
and persecuted, had come into power, he had
made the Scots his implacable foes, and nothing
less than his blood would satisfy them. Despite
of a royal pardon, by an act of arbitrary power on
the part of Parliament, overriding all constitutional
precedents, he was beheaded Jan. 10, 1644.</p>

<p>Why does it takes a hotter fire to melt pewter than

<p class="right">
J. B. L.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Pewter is an alloy, composed of tin
and lead, sometimes with a little copper or antimony
or bismuth, combined in different proportions,
according to the purposes it is to serve.
Plateware, which has a bright, silvery luster
when polished, is composed of 100 parts of tin, 8
parts of antimony, 2 parts of bismuth, and
2 of copper. Brittannia ware is said
to be an alloy of equal parts
of brass, tin, antimony, and bismuth. Now it is
characteristic of alloys that they are always more
easily fusible than the least fusible metal entering
into their composition, and some of them,
strange to say, are more fusible than the least
fusible of their constituents. For instance, although
bismuth alone requires a heat of 476 degrees
Fahrenheit to fuse it, lead 600 degrees, and
tin 442 degrees, an alloy of these metals composed
of five or eight parts of bismuth, two or
five parts of lead, and three of tin, melts at 198
to 200 degrees; and an alloy of sodium composed
of sodium and potassium in certain proportions
melts at 80 degrees, although sodium alone requires
194 degrees and potassium 124 degrees to
fuse them. The explanation is not fully determined,
but it is to be found in the laws of chemical
affinity. Different metals expand at different
rates in the same degree of heat, which tends to
separate the atoms; and electrical currents are
produced which magnify the heat applied externally.</p>

<span class="smcap">Aggie.</span><br>

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The authoress of “Schonberg-Cotta
Family” is Mrs. Elizabeth Rundle Charles, only
child of the late Hon. John Rundle, member of
Parliament for Tavistock. She was born about
1826; received a liberal English education; was
encouraged in literary work by her father; and
has written a number of works of fiction of high
moral tone, including the two historical fictions
“Schonberg-Cotta Family” and the “Diary of Kitty
Trevylyan,” intended to recall the early struggles
of the two great reformers, Luther and Wesley.
Among her other works are “The Martyrs of
Spain and Liberators of Holland.” It is almost
impossible to denote the German pronunciation
of “o” in Schonberg without oral illustrations.
Webster says that to utter this sound one must
place the organs in the position for o long and
then try to utter the sound of e in met. All the
other syllables in the compound word, Schonberg-Cotta,
are to be pronounced nearly as in English,

<p>Is the expression, “There is gold in the sea,” only a
poetic fiction or is it true? As a friend says that there is
gold and silver in some kinds of sea water?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Constant Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Sea water is impregnated with certain
chemical salts, including chlorides, sulphates,
bromides, iodides, and carbonates, some of which
have the power of dissolving gold and silver or
holding them in solution. The chemist Sonstadt
has recently shown that sea water contains nearly
one grain of gold to the ton of water, held in solution
by iodide of calcium; and it has been
known for some years that the old copper stripped
from the bottoms of ships is often so rich in silver
taken from the sea that it pays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
a profit on the cost of smelting it.
It is estimated that the ocean holds in solution at
least 2,000,000 tons of silver. Assuming this to
be the metric ton of 2,204.6 pounds, the above
total is equivalent in weight to 77,448,000,000
American standard dollars—nearly seven times
the total silver product of the world from the earliest
times to the close of 1879, or $11,315,000,
as estimated by that eminent statistician, the
Russian councillor, Otreschkoff. A large discount
might be made from these estimates, and yet
there would be enough left, aside from all the
treasures of sunken Spanish galleons and
oriental argosies, to demonstrate that the saying,
“There is gold in the sea,” is not merely a poetic
fancy.</p>

of selling tickets on each horse at a certain price.
On the race-courses of this country the “mutuals”
are $5 each. When the race is started the
tickets are all added up in one large pool, and
those who hold tickets on the winning horse divide
the total pool, less 5 per cent to the pool-seller.
For example, in a Paris mutual, tickets in
the pool were sold as follows:</p>

</table>

<p>Here there is a net amount of $180.50 to be
divided equally between holders of tickets on the
winning horse. In this case, if horse No. 3 wins,
each of the four ticket-holders receives $45.12.</p>

B. S.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Christopher Columbus was twice
married. His first wife was Felipa Munnis Perestrelle,
daughter of an able Captain of Prince
Henry of Portugal, called the “Navigator.” He
married her in 1471. His father-in-law’s charts,
globes, etc., helped to mature his plans of discovery.
Diego, who accompanied his father on
the occasion when they were reduced to such
straits that Columbus begged at the monastery of
La Rabida for bread and water for the child, was
the only issue of this marriage. This wife died
in 1483 or thereabout. He next married Beatriz
Enriquez, at Cordova, in 1487. She was the
mother of his second son, Fernando Columbus,
who in time became his father’s biographer.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—This is too much like a question in
arithmetic for these columns, from which all
arithmetical problems are ruled out. Several distinct
classes of questions might come up under
“Chronologist’s” query. One of the first considerations
is to determine whether the historical
date is given in “old style” reckoning or “new
style,” as a separate rule must be applied in each
of these cases. Another rule applies to dates before
the Christian era. Leap years are taken into
account in all these rules. Every example involves
an arithmetical computation. There are
“perpetual almanacs” that contain tables and rules
for all such computations. There is a chart published
in this city entitled “Almanac for All Time,
Past and Future,” which answers all queries of
this nature.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The object of the Chicago Flower
Mission is to collect and distribute flowers among
the charitable institutions of the city; chiefly
through the wards of hospitals. The influence of
these cheery tokens of loving sympathy is believed
to be most wholesome. The condition of
the mind has, in most cases of disease, a great
effect on the body. Nothing does more to recuperate
the sick than a hopeful, cheerful spirit,
and a lively love of life and earnest wish to recover.
Flowers and their associations are delightful
reminders of the world in its fairest
phases, and woo the sick back to life with a tender
eloquence akin to love. Letters or offerings
of flowers addressed to the “President of the
Chicago Flower Mission, Atheneum Building,
Chicago,” will reach the mission.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Under the pre-emption laws, which
restrict the pre-emption privilege to heads of
families, widows, or single persons over the age
of 21, who are citizens of the United States or
who have declared their intention to become such,
it has been judicially decided: 1. That if a single
woman marry after filing her declaratory
statement, she thereby abandons her right as a
pre-emptor, although it is not so in the case of
timber-culture claim or homestead entry; 2. The
“head of a family” means the actual, living head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
of a family; hence, that “a deserted wife or one
whose husband is a confirmed drunkard may be
the head of a family;” also, that “a married woman
who has minor children and has been abandoned
by her husband without cause and left to support
and maintain herself and children, is the head of
a family and entitled to pre-empt in her own
name.” Under like circumstances married women
may make homestead and timber-culture entries.
Otherwise a married woman cannot pre-empt
government land or make a homestead or timber-culture
entry.</p>

<p>The report of the Adjutant General of the army
about five years later, Oct. 25, 1870, puts the total
number of deaths in the Union army during the
rebellion at 303,504, while the Surgeon General
of the army reports the number at 282,955.
The Adjutant General reports the total number
killed in battle as 44,238; the Surgeon General
reports 35,408; the former reports the total number
who died of wounds as 33,993; and the latter
as 49,205; the former reports the number who
died of disease as 149,043; the latter as 186,216.
The Quartermaster General reports the total number
of graves under his supervision as 315,555;
only 172,309 of which have been identified.
Taking all things into consideration, the differences,
according to these several reports from
officers of different departments, are, in most instances,
readily accounted for.</p>

<p>According to the only data at hand, the total
Confederate losses in action are estimated as follows:
Killed, 51,525; wounded, 227,871. The
number who died of wounds and disease is not

not clearly stated whether this includes those
killed on the field.</p>

<p>To the above should be added the losses in the
Union and Confederate navies, amounting in the
case of the former to 4,030 killed and wounded in
action; 2,532 died of disease; and 2,070 other
casualties.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">H. N. Baker.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The history of the Church of England
previous to the Reformation is closely connected
with that of the Roman Catholic Church.
Tradition states that some of the Apostles first
carried Christianity to Britain, and the later
work was carried on by Sts. Augustine, Aidan
and Chad. From the eighth till the sixteenth
century the English Church was subject to Rome,
and the final separation was due to the extreme
measures adopted at the Council of Trent. But
for 200 years the seed sown by Wycliffe had been
bearing fruit and preparing the people for the
great work of Luther. From 1066 to 1356 there
was a constant struggle between the civil and
ecclesiastical powers. Then came Wycliffe’s
translation into English of the Bible, and his continued
war against some of the leading doctrines
of the Romish Church, which led to the formation
of a new sect called the Lollards, holding
views similar to those of the present church.
Despite persecution the new doctrines spread,
encouraged by Cranmer, and later by Queen
Elizabeth, until in 1562 the thirty-nine articles
of faith were finally reviewed and adopted, and
Protestantism was recognized as the religion of
England. In 1801, by the “Act of Union,” the
Episcopal churches in England and Ireland were
united but the latter church was disestablished
and disendowed in 1869.</p>

when did Robert Bruce die?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">E. F. Marshall.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—1. Wallace was the younger son of a
Scottish knight of good family in the southwest
of Scotland. Neither the date nor the place of
his birth is definitely known, but the former
must have been about 1270. There is nothing
certain known of his early life. He first comes
into notice as the leader of an insurrectionary
movement against Edward I. who had usurped
the regal rights of John Baliol, King of Scotland,
and held him a prisoner in the Tower of London.
In 1297 the rebellion against Edward had become
general, and Wallace, resolved to force the liberation
of Baliol and the independence of Scotland,
made preparations to invade England. On the
11th of September he defeated the English forces
under the Earl of Surrey at Sterling Castle with
great slaughter, and, pursuing them into Cumberland
and Northumberland, ravaged that portion
of England. On his return he was made
Governor of Scotland, or Regent, in the name of
the imprisoned monarch. This elevation of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
man of comparatively humble birth over the nobility
of Scotland excited fierce jealousy among
the latter, which undoubtedly had much to do
with the defeat of the Scots the subsequent year
by the English King and an overwhelming army
at Falkirk, July 22. The war was continued with
varying fortunes for seven years, but in 1304
Edward compelled the Scots to submit, granting
amnesty to all the insurgent nobles. Wallace,
however, was excepted from amnesty, and, having
been betrayed into the hands of Edward by his
own countrymen, he was carried to London,
where, after a mock trial on the charge of treason,
and the endurance of barbarities of the most
savage nature, he was executed Aug. 23, 1305.
His name is held in reverence by all true Scots,
who now concede to him the glory of having
roused the Scotch love of country, and led the
way to that sturdy resistance of English oppression
which finally resulted in averting the
fate that overtook Ireland. A monument to
Wallace was erected at Abbey Craig, near Stirling,
at a cost of £13,000, and inaugurated Aug.
27, 1869. 2. Robert Bruce, King of Scots, died
at Cardross Castle, on the firth of Clyde, June
7, 1329.</p>

This is the lowest sum, and the
next lowest was in 1793, $6,479,977.97. The
greatest amount any year before the great rebellion
was in 1859, during Buchanan’s administration,
when his Secretary of War was so busy

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Truman Henry Safford, once widely
noticed as “the remarkable boy mathematician,”
was born at Royalton, Vt., Jan. 6, 1836, and graduated
at Harvard in 1854. He compiled an almanac
when he was 9 years old, making all the astronomical
and other calculations. When he was
but about 14 he calculated the elliptic elements of
the first comet of 1849. He was appointed in
1863 Adjunct Observer in the Cambridge University,
and two years later made Acting Director.
While at this observatory he determined
the right ascension of 1,700 stars
and the declination of 450, and
made 6,000 transit observations, besides completing
Professor Bond’s report of discoveries in
the constellation Orion. On Dec. 28, 1865, he accepted
the post of director of the Chicago Observatory,
where he remained until 1878, making
many observations of similar nature to the last

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Hero was a priestess of Venus. Leander
was a youth of Abydos, a famous city on the
Asiatic side of the strait of the Hellespont, nearly
opposite the city of Sestos on the European coast,
where he first saw Hero. It appears to have been
a case of love at first sight, and an intensely
ardent case at that. Hero’s office as priestess, and
the resolute opposition of her parents stood in
the way of their union, cold and strong as the
swift current of the Hellespont, which at this its
narrowest point, is swift and deep, and about one
and a quarter miles wide. Undaunted by all
these obstacles, Leander swam across the strait
every night to visit his beloved, who directed his
course by holding a torch from the upper window
of a tower on the shore. After many delightful
meetings, the dauntless lover was drowned one
stormy night, and his body was washed ashore at
the foot of the tower where Hero stood, expecting
him. Heartbroken at the sight, she flung herself
from the tower into the sea, and passed with her
lover into the immortality of art and song.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Xenophon, son of the Athenian,
Gryllus, was born B. C. 445-4. He was a pupil
of Socrates. He joined the expedition of Cyrus
against Artaxerxes, King of Persia, and in the
retreat of the ten thousand, following the battle
of Cunaxa, became the leader of the Greeks, after
the treacherous execution of their former generals.
A full account of the expedition and retreat
is given in his “Anabasis.” Being banished
from Athens soon after his return, he joined the
Spartan army, in which he fought against his
own countrymen at Coronea. He lived at Scillus,
in Elis, for more than twenty years (until driven
thence by the Eleans), hunting, farming, and
writing. It was there that he wrote the “Anabasis”
and the “Hellenica.” The last years of his
life were passed at Corinth, where he died about
356 B. C. George Grote, politician, historian,
and philosopher, was born at Clay Hill, Beckenham,
Kent, Eng., in 1794. As a statesman he
was in sympathy with the leading reforms of his
time, and made several effective speeches in their
behalf. His first work as an author was upon
parliamentary reform. The preparation of his
history of Greece occupied thirteen years, and
the last two volumes were published in 1856. In
1865 appeared his work on Plato. Thereafter he
devoted himself to the study of Aristotle. 2. The
scythed chariot was used by the Britons and Persians.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
It had two wheels connected by an axle,
upon which rested, without springs, the
body of the chariot, consisting of a
floor with a semi-circular guard in
front about three feet high. It had no
seat, and was open at the back. In it stood the
warrior and his charioteer. Attached to the rims
of the wheels projecting on each side and
bristling from the axle were scythes or blades of
swords for cutting down those who came in the
way.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">James Bond.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—She was born at Florence, Italy, in
1823, being the daughter of William Shore Nightingale,
Embly Park, Hampshire; she was educated
with great care, and was rather notable for
her brilliant accomplishments. Very early she
showed great interest in all institutions for the
alleviation of suffering, and later visited and inspected
hospitals throughout Europe. She studied
with Sisters of Charity in Paris their system of
nursing in the hospitals of that city, and was
trained also in the institution of Protestant
Deaconesses at Kaiserwerthen, on the Rhine.
Later she organized the Sanitarium for Governesses
in London. Soon after the breaking out
of the Crimean war she offered to organize a
nursing department at Scutari, and with the consent
of Lord Herbert left England Oct. 21, 1854,
reaching Constantinople in time to take charge
of the wounded from the battle of Inkerman.
In 1855 she was prostrated by a fever, the result
of overwork, but refused to rest, and remained
in Scutari until the English evacuated
Turkey, July 28, 1856. The British army
almost idolized her. For some years Miss Nightingale
has been an invalid, but she has never
ceased to plan and work for the welfare of soldiers.
At the close of the Crimean war a fund of
$250,000 was subscribed to enable her to establish
a school for the training of nurses, which is
doing a noble work. She has published several
books bearing upon the work to which her life has
been devoted.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">An Old Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There are two or three illustrations
and descriptions of chicken brooders, but they
are all essentially the same thing. Of course the
nearer it comes to being a good substitute for the
hen mother the better it will be. Make a box
about three or four feet square and five or six
inches deep, with a board top and a sheet-iron, or,
still better, a zinc bottom. Some tack a lamb
skin, drooping nearly to the bottom, to the top of
this box and do not use artificial heat;
but the generally approved plan is to
use one lamp and tin flue like those used
in the artificial incubator, hitherto described,
for warming a brooder of this size. Bore
several small auger holes through the top as escape
flues for the heat; or, still better, arrange
three or four tin escape pipes of an inch diameter,
as was done in the “heater” of the incubator,
dropping them down to within a couple of inches
of the bottom of the box. Next cut a strip from
some old blanket, or other coarse, soft woolen
stuff, and tack it around the lower edge of the
box so that it will hang down about four inches
all round. Slash this at intervals of three or four
inches, so that the chicks can push through it.
Now set blocks two inches thick under two
corners and three inches thick under the other
two corners, and your brooder is ready for use.
Keep the temperature up to 80 or 90 deg. Keep the
box thoroughly clean, and move it from one dry
place to another every day or so. Dust the chicks
occasionally with sulphur or pyrethrum, to keep
off vermin, and smear their feathers here and
there with paraffine. On one side of the brooder
there should be a “run” for the chicks to exercise
in, which may be a box covered with laths on top
and sides, but with space next the ground to allow
them to run out. For protection against rats
at night cover the whole brooder with a close box
perforated with small auger-holes for ventilation.</p>

<p>Favor us with a statement of the precise objects and
scope of the Citizens’ League of Illinois, and the chief
provisions of its constitution and by-laws: as we may
conclude to form a branch organization here.</p>

<p class="right">
W. P. J.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The organization is called “The Citizens’
League of the State of Illinois.” Its objects
are the suppression of the sale of liquors to minors
and drunkards, and the enforcement of the
liquor laws. These objects it aims to
effect (1) by enforcing all existing laws and
ordinances, prohibiting the selling or giving
of intoxicating liquors to minors or drunkards,
and prohibiting minors from playing games in
places where liquors are sold, (2) by adopting
from time to time such other means as may be
deemed necessary, or as may in experience be
found advisable for the accomplishment of the
general purposes of the organization, which is the
saving of our youth from habits of dissipation and
vice, and, (3) by organizing and fostering, especially
in every county seat in Illinois, local leagues,
having the same object in view.</p>

<p>Any local league in Illinois, the name of which
contains the words “The Citizens’ League” in
addition to words of distinction, and the constitution
of which is in harmony with the object of
the above association, as expressed in section 2
of article 1 of its constitution, may become a
constitutional branch of this league on the payment
of $10 per annum, with power to send
three delegates to each league meeting.</p>

<p>This organization was founded Nov. 25, 1877,
immediately after the riots that were so prevalent
throughout the country, commencing with the
terrible outbreak at Pittsburg, Pa., in July of that
year. Prominent citizens of Chicago observed
that nearly all the actors in the gangs of rowdies
and loafers that entered manufactories and other
business places, commanding employes to stop
work, were youths under 20 years of age. An investigation
of the causes of juvenile depravity
was instituted. They learned that of the 28,035
persons arrested for crime in Chicago in the
year 1877 no less than 6,818 were under 20
years of age, and that 1,782 of these were committed
to the Bridewell. They also learned that
in that year the arrests of minors had increased
720, and the commitments of minors
to the Bridewell had increased 200
over the number in the preceding
year. With a view of verifying these
figures and learning the causes of this
wholesale demoralization of the young, they
made extensive tours of observation through the
city by day and by night, and they soon satisfied
themselves that it was the liquor and beer
saloons that were transforming the youth of Chicago
into vagrants and desperadoes. They found
scarcely a saloon in which there were no juvenile
customers, while in one of them they found 78,
in another 93, and in another 147 children,
patronizing the bar like adults. Subsequently
detectives were posted at the doors of six prominent
concert saloons on the same evening, with
instructions to count all the people who entered
them between 7 p. m. and midnight. At one
door there were counted 1,680 males, 290 females,
total, 1,979; at another, 1,423 males, 58
females, total, 1,741; at another, 2,609 males,
254 females, total, 2,863; at another, 2,658
males, 148 females, total, 2,806; at another,
1,657 males, 163 females, total, 1,820, and at another,
1,591 males, 94 females, total, 1,685. It
was found impracticable to make a separate
count of the minors who entered these places on
that evening, but it was plainly seen that of these
11,618 male and 1,007 female customers an astonishingly
large proportion were boys and girls.
And as there were at that time about 3,000 saloons
in the city, it was estimated that not less
than 30,000 of the children of Chicago were their
regular patrons. The police confirmed this estimate
and asserted that, in face of State laws and
city ordinances positively prohibiting the sale of
beer and liquor to minors, which were regarded
as dead-letter laws, there were saloon
keepers who made a practice of tempting children
into saloons and making them drunk. The first
overt act of the league was the arrest of one of
these monsters named Baker Born, who had been
guilty of enticing into his saloon nine little boys,
who were on their way home from Sunday school,
and making them drunk. He was arraigned before
Justice Daniel Scully and promptly fined $25
and costs. The league drew great inspiration
from the public indignation which Born’s crime
excited, and from the promptness with which he
was punished; and from that time to the present
it has gone steadily forward, increasing every
year in activity, influence and popularity. The
following table contains a succinct statement of
its operations (prosecutions and outlay) for the
first four years of its existence;</p>

<p>During the first five months of 1882, 500 saloon-keepers
were prosecuted. Of this number, 40
were sent to the Grand Jury, 294 were fined by
justices, and 35 held for trial.</p>

<p>The effect of the operations of the league on
the morals of the youth of Chicago was instantaneous
and permanent. In 1876 the arrests of
minors increased 960, and in 1877 they increased
720; but in 1878, the first year of the league’s
existence, they decreased 1,418, and in 1879 they
decreased 139. And although they have increased
slightly in the last two years, the increase is
amply accounted for by the policy of the city
government and the increase of the population,
which increased 204,208 in the last decade,
against 188,004 in the previous decade. But
notwithstanding both of these adverse influences,
there have never been as many minors arrested in
Chicago in any year since 1877 as there were in
that year. The reduction in the commitments of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
minors to the Bridewell was even more marked.
In 1876 these commitments increased 192, and
in 1877 they increased 255. But ever since the
league was organized they have constantly decreased.
They decreased 211 in 1878; 324 in
1879; 23 in 1880; and 17 in 1881.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Every applicant for a copyright must
state distinctly the name and residence of the
claimant, and whether right is claimed as author,
designer, or proprietor. A printed copy of the
title of the book, map, chart, dramatic or musical
composition, engraving, cut, print, or photograph,
or a description of the painting, drawing, chromo,
statue, statuary, or model or design for work of
the fine arts, for which copyright is desired, must
be sent by mail or otherwise, prepaid, addressed,
“Librarian of Congress, Washington, D. C.” This
must be done before publication of the book or
other article. Publication in this connection
means the giving to the public or vending of the
article. A fee of 50 cents for recording the title
of the book, dramatic composition, or other article
must be inclosed with the title and application,
and 50 cents in addition for each certificate
of copyright under seal of the Librarian of Congress,
which will be transmitted by early mail.
One certificate being all that is usually needed,
$1 is the total necessary inclosure. Within ten
days after publication of the book or other article,
two complete copies must be sent prepaid to the
Librarian of Congress, to perfect the copyright.
Without the deposit of these copies, not only is
the copyright void, but a penalty of $25 is incurred.
No copyright is valid unless notice is
given by inserting in every copy published the
following words: “Entered according to act of
Congress in the year 18—, by ——, in the office of the
Librarian of Congress, at Washington;” or else the
words: “Copyright, 18—, by ——.” The law imposes
a penalty of $100 upon any person who inserts
the above words or others of the same import,
in or upon any book or other article before
he has obtained copyright. Each copyright secures
the exclusive right of publishing the book
or article for twenty-eight years. Six months before
the end of that time, the author or designer,
or his widow or children, may secure a renewal
for the further term of fourteen years.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There is no authoritative definition

be pretty well agreed that society as now constituted
is utterly wrong from foundation to turret,
and most of them are in favor of overturning existing
governments, casting to the winds the prevailing
conceptions of individual, family, and
social rights, and returning to a state of anarchy,
if need be, to begin the work of reconstruction
anew. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nihil</i>

palaces, government offices, and even towns and
cities, in the effort to annihilate all existing doctrines

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">T. J. Casto.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Norman horses are named from
Normandy, France, and, although distinguished
by different names, are probably all of one blood,
the names only being of local origin. James M.
Hiatt, in the “National Register of Norman
Horses,” maintains that the Percherons are derived
from the Boulonnais and the Breton horses,
the former of Bourbourg, France, and the latter
of Bretagne. The Clydesdale horse takes its
name from a district on the Clyde, in Scotland,
where it was introduced by one of the dukes of
Hamilton, who crossed the native Lanark mares
with fine heavy Flemish stallions. It is proper to
speak of “thoroughbred Norman horses,” or
“thoroughbred Clydesdales,” but when the term
thoroughbred is used without any qualifying
word it is understood to refer to horses bred for
speed, with undisputed pedigree in the Stud-book.</p>

entry of such lands in the States of California,
Oregon, and Nevada, and the Territories. The

that he is a citizen, that he intends within three
years to reclaim the said tract of desert land by

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">W. W. Turner.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There never has been any uniform
rate of reduction of the National debt. It varies
with the changes in the revenue laws, the business
of the country, and appropriations from the
Treasury for other purposes. The pension arrears
act has already retarded the payment of the
debt by over $100,000,000, and will continue to
be a heavy drain for years to come. The recent
reduction of the tariff and internal revenue taxes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
will reduce the National income greatly. The
total debt at the highest point, Aug. 31, 1865,
was $2,844,649,626; on Aug. 31, 1880, fifteen
years later, it was $2,105,386,267. This shows
an average reduction of nearly $50,000,000 a
year. For the two years ending June 30, 1882, the
reduction was $202,103,376, or over $101,000,000
per annum. With the recent reductions of the
tariff and internal revenue and the heavy drafts
for pensions it is not likely that this rate of debt
reduction will be maintained, a rate which would
extinguish the whole debt by the year 1900. It
is proper to add that, deducting cash in the

$88,218,055, the net debt at the highest point
was $2,756,431,571.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Adolph Eric Nordenskjold (born
1832), was educated at the University of Borgo,
and afterward studied at Helsingfors, an important
naval station on the Baltic. After teaching
mathematics for two years, he was cashiered for
his political opinions in 1855, but returned in the
following year only to be again driven from the
country. In 1858, however, he was appointed
State Mineralogist at Stockholm, and in 1867 he
married Countess Anna Mannerheim, a Finnish
lady—an event that led him to seek an appointment
to the chair of Mineralogy and Geology at
Helsingfors, but the government again refused
for political reasons. Nordenskjold now obtained
naturalization papers as a Swedish citizen, and
entered Swedish politics. He sailed in the Vega,
to find a northeast passage, July 4, 1878, and
reached Yokohama, via the discovered passage, in
September, 1879.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>.—Communism is the doctrine that society
should be reorganized on the basis of abolishing
individual ownership of property and control
of wages, and most of the now generally admitted
rights of individuals in their private
and domestic relations, and substituting
therefor community ownership and control of
every person and everything. Socialism is a sort
of limited communism. It would not entirely
abolish individual rights of property and personal
self-control, but seeks to force a
more equitable distribution of property, and
level the present extreme distinctions between
men of various classes. To effect their purpose
radical socialists have rendered themselves obnoxious
to many who would accept most of the
principles laid down by their great leader, Saint
Simon, by advocating resort to revolutionary
methods of the most reprehensible kinds, including
in some places the use of dynamite and
the assassin’s dagger.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—A mushroom is a genus of fungi, including
many species, edible and poisonous. It
grows in marshy places during the warm months.
Often the name is restricted to the species used
as food, which is regularly convex, fleshy, dry,
and white, with a tinge of brown or yellow. It is
smooth or scaly on the upper surface, never
warty; on the under side the gills are pink when
young, and later turn brown. Toward the top of
the fleshy stem is a white, membraneous ring.
The plant is best for food when young, being then
in the form of a ball, covered with a thin membrane.
The toadstool (“frogstool”) resembles the
mushroom, but the top is shiny, white, or dark
red, and the gills are perpendicular. This species
is poisonous.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">S. R. Roose.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There has been no such time since the
adoption of the present Constitution. The nearest
the Federal Government ever came to such a humiliation
was in 1860, when, through the cutting
down of the tariff in 1857 and the outrageous expenditures
during President Buchanan’s administration,
the National debt had swelled to over
$64,000,000, and money could not be raised on
United States Treasury notes at less than 10, 11,
and finally 12 per cent interest. Then John A. Dix,
who succeeded Cobb as Secretary of the Treasury,
about the close of 1860, found the public credit so
low that, in desperation, he recommended to the
Committee of Ways and Means that the States
be asked to secure the repayment of money
which the government should borrow, by pledging
the repayment for this purpose of the public
deposits received by them in the distribution of
the surplus in the United States Treasury in
1836. However, Congress did not adopt this
recommendation.</p>

<p>During the revolutionary times, before and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
under the old Articles of Confederation, Congress
had no authority to levy and collect taxes and
customs dues, as it has now. Various plans for
raising money were discussed, all dependent on
the sanction of the several colonial or State Legislatures.
The first plan resorted to for using the
credit of the General Government was to issue
paper money. Three modes of doing this were
considered: First, “That every colony should
strike for itself the sum apportioned by the Continental
Congress; secondly, that the Continental
Congress should strike the whole sum necessary,
and each colony become bound to sink its
proportionable part; thirdly, that the Continental
Congress should strike the whole sum,
and apportion the several shares to the different
Colonies,” every Colony becoming bound to discharge
its own particular part, and all the Colonies
to discharge the portion which any particular
Colony should be unable to pay. The views
of the delegates were widely divergent, but Congress
decided, June 22, 1775—more than a year
before the Declaration of Independence—to issue
bills of credit, not exceeding 2,000,000 Spanish
milled dollars, pledging the faith of the twelve
Confederate Colonies for their redemption. The
sum was subsequently increased to $3,000,000,
and apportioned, on the basis of population,
among the Colonies that had joined the confederation—not
then including Georgia—as follows:</p>

<p>Each Colony was to pay its respective quota in
four equal annual installments, commencing on
the last day of November, 1779; and for this
purpose each was to levy and collect taxes. But,
though from first to last the States insisted upon
retaining the power to tax, and Congress was
obliged to trust wholly to them for funds raised
in this manner, they did not tax themselves, as
they were in duty bound to do, and neither contributed
as they should have done to sustain the
National Government, nor raised much to sustain
their own organizations, civil and military.
“Throughout the entire period from 1774 to
1789,” says Bolles, “only very small sums flowed
into the general treasury from the State treasuries.”</p>

<p>In the spring of 1780 Congress resolved, after a
great many whereases, “to receive silver and gold
in payment of the quotas assigned to the States,
at the rate of one Spanish milled dollar in lieu of
$40 of the bills then in circulation.” Subsequent
loans were made, and the debt apportioned
among the several States; but the latter
paid but a trifling part of their assessments,
as shown by the following table, giving the assessment
on each State on account of the requisition
of Congress for $8,000,000 in November,
1781, and the amount actually paid to the end of
1783, as given in “Bolles’ Financial History of

issuing printed newspapers in the following
order: England in 1622; France, 1631; Sweden,
1644; Holland, 1656; Russia, 1703; Turkey,
1827. The progress of journalism has been most

1690, under the name of “Publick Occurences,
both Foreign and Domestic,” but it was immediately
suppressed. In 1704 the Boston <cite>News

<p>What class of persons are allowed to vote for members

<p class="right">
T. W.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The “Commons of England” consists
of the representatives of shires or counties, representatives
of cities, and representatives of
boroughs. For representatives of boroughs every
man is entitled to vote who is of full age and not
subject to any legal incapacity, provided he is on
the last day of July in any year, and has during
the whole of the preceding twelve months been
an “inhabitant occupier,” as owner or tenant, of
any dwelling-house within the borough; has during
the time of such occupation been rated (or
taxed) “as an ordinary occupier in respect of the
premises so occupied by him within the borough
to all rates made for the relief of the poor in respect
of such premises,” and has paid the said
rate; or has occupied as a lodger in the same
borough separately, and as sole tenant for the
time above designated, “a part of one and the
same dwelling house, of a clear yearly value,
if let unfurnished, of £10 or upward.” For representatives
of counties any man may be registered
as a voter who is of full age, and not subject to
any legal incapacity, who shall be in possession
at law or in equity of any lands or tenements, of
copyhold, or any other tenure whatever, except
freehold, for his own lifetime or for the life of another
or for any larger estate of the clear yearly
value of not less than £5 over and above all rents
and charges, who is on the last day of July of any
year (and has been during the preceding twelve
months) the occupier as owner or tenant of lands
or tenements within the county of the ratable
value of £12 or upward, and has paid all poor
rates rated to him. The qualifications of city
electors are not materially different from those
above given. Of the 487 members for England
and Wales, 187 represent counties, 295 cities and
boroughs, and 5 represent the three universities.</p>

<p>The qualifications of electors in Scotland
and Ireland are somewhat different.
In Scotland, the burgher franchise is given to
every man of full age who has been for twelve
months an occupier, as owner or tenant, of any
dwelling, and has paid his poor rates, and not
been in receipt of parochial relief during that
time. The lodger franchise consists in the permission
of any lodger to vote who has occupied
in the same burgh separately, and as sole tenant
for twelve months, a lodging worth £10. In the
counties the ownership franchise requires the property
to be worth an annual net rental of £5, and a
residential qualification of six months. In Ireland
the borough franchise requires a lodging of
the value of £4, where in England it must be at
least £10, the other qualifications being similar
to those required in England.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Perhaps the earliest form of a type-writer
is a rude machine invented in England in
1714, without any practical fruits. M. Foucault,
sent to the Paris Exposition of 1855 a writing
machine for the blind; but the first of what are
now popularly known as type-writers was
patented in 1868, by C. L. Sholes, of Wisconsin.
This has been improved until now it is possible to
attain a speed of seventy-five to eighty words a
minute in writing with this machine, which is
fast enough for reporting speeches. The principal
advantages gained are rapidity of execution
and legibility. A type-writer can write with both
hands and several fingers in instant succession,
every letter being made with a single light touch
instead of requiring from three to seven distinct
strokes and dots, as in ordinary script.</p>

<p>By whom and when was the remark used: “Millions

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">John J. Maginnis.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>.—An ill-feeling grew up between the
United States and France soon after the breaking
out of the great French revolution, near the close
of the last century. France seemed determined
that our government should take active part with
it in hostilities against Great Britain. Washington
and the Federal party insisted on strict
neutrality. The French Minister, Citizen Genet,
encouraged by the strong French sympathies of
the Republicans of those days and the almost
universal ill-feeling toward Great Britain, undertook
to set President Washington’s proclamation
of neutrality at defiance by an appeal to the
people, encouraged the organization of secret
political societies opposed to the administration,
and even instituted recruiting for the French army
on American soil. His course became so obnoxious
that Washington demanded his recall.
M. Fauchet was sent to succeed him, but the ill-feeling
rather increased than diminished. In
1796 Charles C. Pinckney, of South Carolina, one
of our revolutionary heroes, was sent to France
as United States Minister, charged, among other
matters, to negotiate a settlement of all differences,
on the basis of American neutrality. The
French Directory treated him with an incivility
almost unbearable, and finally ordered him to
quit the country. He withdrew to Amsterdam
for a time, but, on some change of affairs in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
France, returned in the early part of 1797, when
Talleyrand, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs,
declined to treat further until his government
had received a payment from the United
States in the nature of a present or tribute, and
threatened war as the consequence of a refusal.
Thereupon Pinckney gave utterance to the patriotic
exclamation, “War be it then; millions for
defense, sir, but not a cent for tribute.” These
words were caught up by the administration
party at home and echoed and re-echoed throughout
the land until, in 1798, Congress was nerved
to provide a strong naval armament. Later Washington,

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There is a small circle in Central
Florida where the annual rainfall ranges from
sixty to seventy inches. There is a belt covering
Western Alabama, Eastern Mississippi, also
Southern Louisiana for fifty to sixty miles on
either side of the Mississippi River, where it
measures from sixty to sixty-four inches. But
the heaviest rainfall in the United States is in
Alaska, where it is over eighty inches, and
along the western coast of Oregon and
Washington Territory, between the Cascade
Range and the Pacific, increasing from sixty-eight
inches south of the Columbia River to eighty
inches on Puget Sound. In Central Georgia and
South Carolina it is fifty-two to forty-eight; in
Central North Carolina and Virginia, diminishing
northward, it is forty-eight to thirty-six. Along
the Atlantic coast, for about seventy-five miles
inward, it ranges from forty-four inches at
Savannah to forty in Connecticut, and thence
increases to forty-four in Northern Maine.
Along both flanks of the Alleghanies and Blue
Ridge it is nearly uniform at 40. In most of the
region south of the Ohio and Missouri, from
Eastern Tennessee to Eastern Texas, it ranges
from 48 inches in the south to 44 in the north,
and the latter is about the average for Southern
Indiana and Southwestern Ohio. The average
for Illinois and Northern Indiana and Pennsylvania
is about 40. For Western New York,
Northern Ohio, lower Michigan, Wisconsin,
Southeastern Minnesota, and most of Iowa it
ranges from 40 to 32, diminishing toward the
great lakes. West of the Missouri it ranges from
30 inches in Eastern Kansas to 26 in Dakota,
and diminishes toward the Rocky Mountains.
In Southern Texas it ranges from 48 near the
southeastern corner to 28 on the Rio Grande, and
diminishes to 34 in the northeastern, and 29 in
the northwestern corners. In California the rainfall
ranges from 60 inches on the northern coast
to 9 or 10 in the south, and diminishes inland to
8 or 10 in the mountain districts, and still less in
the desert regions. As for the greater part of the
region embracing all the Territories except
Alaska, Washington, and Southeastern Dakota,
all of Colorado and Nevada, the western parts of
Kansas, Nebraska and Dakota, and the eastern
portion of Oregon, the rainfall varies between 10
inches and 22. Here and there within this region
there are districts almost rainless. This is
most common in Northern Arizona and Utah.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="smcap">Dunlap</span>, Iowa.<br>
</p>

<p>Please give a short sketch of the lives of the three
noted educational reformers, Pestalozzi, F. Froebel,
and Horace Mann.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">John Keitges.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Pestalozzi, the famous Swiss educator,
was born at Zurich Jan. 12, 1746. In his
youth he was evidently undecided as to what profession
to follow. He was first a theological student
and then a law student. Having purchased
some waste land, he turned from the law to farming,
where he became interested in the welfare of
the masses and devoted himself, during the intervals
of his work, to promoting their
elevation. Convinced that a rational system
of education would remedy many of the
evils of society, he converted his own house into
an orphan asylum, and strove, by judicious blending
of industrial, intellectual, and moral training,
to illustrate his theory of a sound system of national
education. The great idea at the basis of
his system of instruction was the necessity of
teaching by object lessons. Objects themselves,
and not lessons about objects, were the means
that he used to develop the observing and reasoning
powers. He gave special attention to the
moral and religious training of children, as something
distinct from mere instruction in morals
and religion. For two years Froebel, the father
of the kindergarten system, was his
pupil and assistant teacher. He died at
Brugg, Switzerland, in 1827. Friedrich Wilhelm
A. Froebel, to whom reference has just
been made, was born at Ober-Weissbach, Germany,
April 21, 1782. When sent to school he
was so dull that his father, growing discouraged,
took him from study and sent him to work among
the wood-cutters in the forest. Here he became
a student of nature and advanced, as Pestalozzi,
upon his farm, to the idea of teaching from nature.
In 1799 he went to school again, but falling
into debt, was imprisoned by his creditors.
Soon after his release he became a pupil and assistant
of Pestalozzi, remaining with this great
master from 1807 to 1809. He then began the
study of the natural sciences, but was interrupted
by the German and French war of 1813, in which
he enlisted for fatherland. On the restoration
of peace he became curator of the Museum of
Mineralogy, under Professor Weiss, at Berlin.
A few years later he began his life as a teacher,
which, in 1826, the year previous to the death of
Pestalozzi, he varied by publishing a work entitled
“The Education of Man.” In this book he
declared that man’s life was a succession of
stages, each of which should be progressive. He
was especially impressed with the importance of
the first years of childhood as the period in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
to give shape to all their after development. In
1837 he established the first kindergarten school,
at Blankenburg. Having noticed the restlessness
of children, and tendency to finger everything,
he took advantage of these traits to
arouse in them a spirit of intelligent inquiry
and investigation. Much of his
time was given, in schools of Germany
and Switzerland, to training primary teachers. In
the latter part of his life he gave special attention
to the training of young female teachers, believing
them to be best calculated by nature for the
care and management of young children. During
the revolutionary period of 1848, at a time when,
through the influence of the great Middendorff,
who had become interested in his kindergarten
work, he hoped to enlist the support of the German
Parliament in his system of teaching, he and
his brother Karl were charged with socialistic
tendencies, and an edict was issued forbidding
the establishment of schools “after Friedrich and
Karl Froebel’s principles” in Prussia. This blow
utterly disheartened the veteran educator, and he
died in June, 1852, at Marienthal.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">COLD IN DAKOTA.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Chicago</span>, Ill.<br>
</p>

<p>In the interview with Mr. Geo. B. Armstrong, Register
of the Government land office at Huron, D. T., recently
published in <span class="smcap">The Inter Ocean</span>, he asserts, substantially,
that it is colder in Chicago with the mercury
5 deg. below zero than it is in Huron with the
mercury 35 to 38 deg. below. A number of us, who
swear by the Curiosity Shop, have got into a dispute
over this statement and all agree to leave it to the editor
of “the shop” to decide the matter. The question
is: Is it as cold in Huron, D. T., as in this city, on the
average?</p>

<p class="right">
G. H.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—In one sense of the word, it is unquestionably
colder in Huron than in Chicago.
But Mr. Armstrong has not left our readers in
doubt as to his meaning. He distinctly says:
“With the mercury in the thermometer as low as
35 and 38 degrees below zero, we do not suffer so
much as the people in Chicago with the thermometer
at 5 degrees below zero. The air is dry and
comfortable.” Here he clearly discriminates
between the cold of the atmosphere
and the sense of cold experienced
by human beings. There is no ground for dispute
as to the comparative average winter cold of
the climate of Southern Dakota in and about
Huron, and the same at Chicago. The thermometer
shows that the former is several degrees
greater than the latter. But taking cold in the
second sense of the word, “the sensation produced
by the escape of heat” from the body;
“chilliness or chillness”—see Webster’s second
definition—every one knows by actual experience
that this depends to a considerable degree upon
the dryness and stillness of the atmosphere and
the state of the body. Exposed to a high wind in
humid atmosphere not more than 5 or 6 degrees
below zero, a person may freeze to death,
when he would endure 35 or 40 degrees below
zero in a dry, still air without serious suffering.
Such air is classed among the poorest of all
heat conductors; it belongs rather to non-conductors.
The sensation of cold is due to the conduction
of heat from the body more rapidly than
the vital forces can replace it. Moist air in rapid
motion carries off heat with great rapidity. When
the skin pores are open a considerable part
of the fluids of the body exudes
through them, dampens the garments,
and so renders them better conductors.
The cold and wind evaporate this moisture in the
garments. Evaporation is a cooling process; so
when the pores are not kept almost sealed up by
steady cold the body suffers loss of temperature
both by increased conduction and evaporation.
Observations of the United States Signal Service
denote that the atmosphere of the region of
Dakota under consideration is dryer, stiller, and
less subject to extreme changes than that of Chicago;
so that it is possible that, while in one sense
of the word cold, it is certainly colder in Huron
than it is in Chicago, in the other sense it may be
no colder or not so cold there as here. This is
plainly a question of personal experience, and the
best that Our Curiosity Shop can do to settle this
dispute is to give the above facts, and add that
the testimony of many credible witnesses who
have tried both climates is to the effect that,
taking the winter through, one feels the cold
there no more, or not so much as here. If a
wager turns on our decision, taking the word cold
in its first sense, the answer given above is definite
and positive; taking it in the second sense, it
is indecisive; a case for “a draw.”</p>

<p class="center no-indent">ANCHOR ICE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laporte City</span>, Iowa.—In the Curiosity Shop
for June 14 I see a correspondent asks an explanation
of ice forming at the bottom of rivers
and remaining there. I saw this ice for the first
time three years ago the past winter, at Waterloo,
in this State, where business kept me most of the
time. It excited my curiosity, and I studied it
until satisfied of its origin. The Cedar River runs
through the city, and a dam is built across it giving
a power of about eight feet fall. A short distance
below this is a bridge over 600 feet long.
The space between the dam and the bridge is a
rock-bottom rapids. Having occasion to cross
the bridge frequently I noticed this ice attached
to the rocks under water after the weather became
cold, but not cold enough to form a solid
sheet of ice on the pond. It disappeared and
came again as the weather changed to warm or
cold, but ceased to be formed after the pond was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
covered with a solid cake of ice, always forming
at the beginning of cold weather. I concluded it
was caused by the formation of fine crystals of
ice on the pond not yet frozen together, which, as
they were carried over the dam, were mixed in
the surf below and driven against and stuck fast
in the fine moss covering the rocks, always attached
to the side of the rock facing the fall, the
first crystals presenting points to catch the next,
and so the mass, which appeared like water-soaked
snow, grew under the water by accretion,
the water being as cold as the ice itself could not
thaw it. I think if the correspondent will examine
he will find anchor ice is formed in rapids or
at the foot of falls draining a smooth expanse of
water before the water becomes covered with a
solid sheet of ice, and always on the up-stream
side of the rocks in the bottom.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It was called by this name by the

America, its native region, because they fancied it
to be a representative of Christ’s passion or sacrificial
death. According to this fancy, the leaf
symbolizes the spear that pierced the Savior’s
side; the anthers, the marks of the five wounds
made by the spear; the tendrils, the cords or whips
with which He was secured; the column of the
ovary, the upright of the cross; the stamens, the
hammers; the three styles, the nails; the filamentous
processes, the crown of thorns; the
calyx, the glory or halo; the white tinge, purity;
the blue tint, heaven; and the fact that it remains

<span class="smcap">H. T. McLane.</span><br>
</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Asbestos is a fibrous, white, gray, or
green mineral, not easily fusible. The most
beautiful specimens come from Corsica and
Savoy, though some are found in the Alps,
Pyrenees, and Ural Mountains, and in North
America and New South Wales, while commoner
varieties, such as mountain cork and mountain
wood, are found in Lanarkshire, Tyrol, Dauphiny
and parts of Scotland. Its chief value is its
infusibility, and though it possesses little consistency,
it was by the ancients woven into garments,
towels, and handkerchiefs, and has in
later times become useful as fireproof roofing,
flooring, and packing in safes, journal boxes, and
around steam pipes. Paper has been made of it,
but though at red heat the paper remains uninjured,
the writing disappears. As cloth it is
desirable, needing only to be thrown into the
fire to be cleansed. It is said that Charlemagne
had a table cloth of asbestos, which he was wont
to throw into the fire at the close of the meal for

<p class="center no-indent">HOW TO USE AN INCUBATOR.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Elk Grove</span>, Wis.<br>
</p>

<p>Our Curiosity Shop has explained how to make an
artificial incubator; how do you use one after it is
made?</p>

<p class="right">
“I.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Mrs. P. G. Gilman, Paola, Kan.; Mrs.
L. R. Stanley, Cameron, Neb.; C. D., Kalamazoo,
Mich., make substantially the same inquiry.</p>

<p>In the first place be sure to get fresh eggs, which
have not been chilled to death in the nest, and
sort out all unfertile ones. After the eggs have
been in the incubator two, or at most three days,
you can tell every egg that is not fertile. By
placing the small end to the eye, looking toward
the sun, and moving the head up and down, you
will see a dark spot floating on the top of every
fertile egg. Any egg that remains perfectly
clear after being in the incubator until the fourth
day may as well be taken out for use or for market,
since it will never hatch. Some persons recommend
the use of a cheap egg-tester, which can
be got by writing to the Secretary of the National
American Poultry Association, New Concord,
Ohio, but others think this is not needed. The
eggs must be kept at a regular heat of between
102 and 105 degs. After the third day take
out the egg-drawer once a day and let the eggs
cool down to about 70 or 80 degs., but not
below 65 degs. Turn the eggs every four or
five hours during the day, by moving the muslin
frame on which the eggs rest backward or forward
a couple of inches, as indicated in the instructions
for making the incubator. It is all
done in a trice; it will be well to do this once during
the night, and see that the temperature is up
to proper grade. Be careful that it does not rise
above 105 degs., as there is even more danger of
killing the eggs by over-heating than by letting
the temperature run a little low. After the third
day set two or more soup-plates or tin pie-pans on
the sawdust in the ventilator, under the eggs to
moisten them; and from the ninth to the twelfth
day sprinkle a little tepid water on the eggs by
hand, in addition to the evaporation from the
water in the pans. From the twelfth to the
fifteenth day hand-sprinkle them twice a day, and
thereafter three times a day until they hatch.
The water acts on the lime of the shells
to make it brittle. Perhaps it is best not to have
any fire in the incubator-room, which may be a
cellar, wood shed, or unoccupied room in the
house. A writer in the <cite>American Agriculturist</cite>
says: “If any one doubts that pine sawdust in
an incubator will kill his eggs let him try it.”
There may be something in this warning, but it
is doubtful. Study your lamps to learn about
how high to turn the wicks, in order to keep the
temperature just right, and observe the thermometers
in the front and back of your egg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
drawer frequently. See that the escape pipes in
the heater do not slip down so close to the zinc
as to check the draft. Better keep them from one
to two inches above the zinc. Keep the ventilators
open.</p>

<p>When the eggs are hatched keep the chicks in
the incubator till dried, anywhere from twelve to
eighteen hours, but not longer. Put them in the
brooder, or “artificial mother,” which will be described
hereafter. Give them their first food
when they are about 18 or 20 hours
old. Use bread crumbs wet with milk,
or corn meal thoroughly soaked, or
hard-boiled eggs, and feed regularly at intervals
of three or four hours from 5 o’clock a. m. to 9
o’clock p. m. Do not over-feed; give them only
what they will eat clean. When old enough give
them dry grain.</p>

cedar posts.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">H. H. Oberton.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There are different inspection rules
at nearly all the great centers of the lumber trade.
There are the “Albany Inspection,” governing
the lumber product of Northern New York, the
“Maine survey,” the “Boston inspection,” the
“Saginaw inspection,” the “Chicago cargo inspection,”
“Chicago yard grading,” “St. Louis
inspection,” “Minneapolis inspection,” and several
others. The differences at the several Western
centers do not differ very greatly. The following
grading is according to the rules of Chicago
yard grading:</p>

<p>Flooring—A, or firsts, should have one face
nearly clear, with but one or two small, sound
knots; the other side may have more knots or
sap. B, or seconds, may have two to four sound,
medium knots, and bright sap equal to 1 or 1¼
inches width. C, or thirds, will allow of three to
six small, sound knots, or 1½ to 2 inches of
bright sap.</p>

<p>Fencing flooring is good common flooring from
selected fence boards, and may have a large number
of small, sound knots, but the general character
of the piece must be such as to make a good,
tight floor, practically free from “shake” and
loose knots.</p>

<p>Fencing—No. 1, or common, contains sound
knots only, not to weaken the piece, and may
have considerable sap, bright, dull, or stained.
No. 2 contains black sap, coarse knots, and
boards shaky or otherwise defective, provided
they are not unfit for coarse fencing.</p>

<p>Strips and Siding—First and second clear, No.
1, must be perfect in thickness, width, and quality,
as clear lumber, free from knots and sap.
No. 2 will admit of a narrow, bright sap on one
side, or one or two knots. A, or first common, if
free from knots, may have two or three small
sound knots, or bright sap, one-half or three-quarters
of an inch wide. B, or second common,
may have three or four medium-sized sound
knots, or bright sap of 1 to 1½ inches wide. C,
or third common, may have two to six medium
knots, 2 to 3 inches of sap, or both sap and knots
to equal these. Six-inch half-round live cedar
posts must be of trees alive when felled, free
from rot or decay of any kind, and not less than
six inches at small end.</p>

<p>The St. Louis inspection rules for white pine
lumber are almost identical with those of Chicago.
Minneapolis rules allow 1 inch sap and
three small knots, but no other imperfections in
first flooring; six small knots and 1½-inch sap in
second flooring; 1-inch sap on thin edge, but no
other imperfections in first siding, dressed; three
small knots and 1-inch sap on either side in second
siding. Grading in the Upper Mississippi
River towns is influenced strongly by the Minneapolis
rules.</p>

<p>1. I saw an account of a black letter Bible recently

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The type commonly known in this
country as black letter, or Gothic, was the first
used in printing, being a copy of the letters used
in Germany and the Netherlands during the
fifteenth century. In the next century the
Gothic style was superseded by the Roman.
Books in black letter are highly prized because of
their antiquity and rarity. 2. The meaning is
that all of the judges of the court in question
hear and decide the case: that is, occupy the
“banc,” or bench, together.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Mrs. Mary Ashton Livermore, the
popular platform orator and reformer, is the
daughter of Timothy Rice. Esq. She was born in
Boston in 1821, educated in the Baptist Seminary
for Girls at Charlestown, Mass., where she gave brilliant
promise of a useful future. She married the
Rev. D. P. Livermore, of the Universalist Church,
and assisted him in editing a paper of this denomination
in Chicago. She was in this city during
the late civil war and took a prominent part
in the various movements to ameliorate the sufferings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
of soldiers on the field, in hospitals and
prisons. She was an ever active, devoted and
most efficient worker in the cause of the
U. S. Sanitary Commission, and was one
of the ablest associates of that eminent
philanthropist, Mrs. A. C. Hoge, in the
organization and marvelous success of the Chicago
Sanitary Fair near the close of the war. She
is now undoubtedly one of the ablest leaders in
the cause of woman, in the various movements of
the times. An eloquent speaker, a brilliant and
powerful writer, a remarkable organizer and
parliamentarian, she never fails to command respect
and carry a strong influence. She is one of
the associate editors of the Boston <cite>Woman’s
Journal</cite>, and is recognized as one of the most
eloquent lecturers in the cause of temperance,
woman suffrage, and other social reforms.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">POINTS IN THE ROAD LAW.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Somonauk</span>, Ill.<br>
</p>

<p>1. The law of Illinois says that any one who forbids
or hinders a person while he is working on the public
road shall be fined $2. I quote from memory. Who
should make the complaint and before what court?
2. What rights, exclusively his own, has a man to one-half
of the road adjoining his farm, and what rights
have the public?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Amasa C. Lord.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Section 33 of chapter on roads and
bridges, Revised Statutes, says: “If any person,
after appearing (to work on the roads), remain
idle, or do not work faithfully, or hinder others
from working, such offender shall, for every offense,
forfeit to the town the sum of $2.” It is
the duty of the overseer of highways to make the
complaint, in case of a violation of this law, before
a justice of the peace. 2. In case of
the vacation of a road, the title
to the land reverts to the original
owner, his heirs, assigns, or grantees. If the
roadway was condemned for highway purposes,
and damages for public appropriation of the
same paid to the owner, several nice legal questions
would be likely to arise in case of vacation of the
road. When land has been given or legally taken
for a highway, the abutting owner has the right
to insist that it shall be used for no other purpose.
The tree-culture laws of most States give
him the right to plant trees along it, subject, however,
to State, county, and town regulations.
These can hardly be called “exclusive rights;” it
can scarcely be said that he has any such, so long
as the land is used as a highway; but the public
have no right to use it for any other purpose, or
do anything therewith inconsistent with such
use.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—He was a distinguished military

His full designation is Count Kurt Christian von
Schwerin. He entered the Dutch army as ensign
when only 16 years of age, fought under the
famous Prince Eugene and the great Marlborough
against the French in the “War of the Spanish
Succession,” and subsequently entered the service
of Frederick the Great of Prussia. He won the
decisive victory over the Austrians at Mollwitz in
1741 which resulted in the cession of Silesia to
Prussia; and Frederick signalized his admiration
of the great captain by conferring on him the
title of Count and making him a Field Marshal.
He fell in battle before Prague in 1757, during
the Seven Years War, better known to Americans
as the French and Indian war, which was a part
of the same general war.</p>

home manufactures by means of a tariff which
should serve the double purpose of public revenue
and protection to home industry. This tariff by

</p>

<p>How is the telephone operated in the city of Chicago?
Give an illustration of how messages are conveyed
by telephone. Is electricity used on all telephone
instruments? Does each person having an
instrument have a separate wire at the central office?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">S. Grady.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—In telegraphy the wire between stations
is a magnet only so long as the electrical
current is passing over it, which is the case so
long as the wire is connected with the battery.
This connection is made or broken by means of
a small lever under the finger of the operator at
the transmitting station, known as the transmitting
key. While the current is on and the wire
is a magnet it attracts to itself a piece of soft iron
at the receiving station, known in the Morse
writing telegraph as the recording style. The
instant the connection between the battery and
the wire is broken the latter ceases to be a magnet,
and the soft iron at the receiving station
springs back to its old place. By this means
every movement of the transmitting key is instantly
repeated at the receiving station. In the
telephone two thin metallic plates or diaphragms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
are substituted for the key and the soft
iron recording style. The undulations of the air
produced by the voice of the speaker cause the
thin plate in the transmitting instrument to vibrate
more or less violently, in harmony with the
voice. This plate is so connected with the wires
running between the battery and the receiving
station that the electrical current over the circuit
is entirely closed or broken, or varied in intensity,
according to the degree of vibration, while the receiving
plate, at the other end of the wire, vibrates
in unison with the transmitting plate, reproducing
undulations in the air at that end of
the wire directly corresponding with the undulations
made by the voice of the speaker—that is,
reproducing the sounds of his voice. Electricity
is used in all telephones of any practical value.
In Chicago the main wires and the branches from
the down-town offices center at a common
office, known as the central station,
where, by means of couplings made
by the movement of certain keys,
separate wires are instantly joined or disconnected.
Any one wishing to communicate by
telephone turns a small crank, which rings a bell
at the central office. The operator at the latter
place responds by signal. The person who wishes
to communicate generally inquires, “Is this the
central office?” Having received an affirmative
reply, he requests to be put into communication
with the number in the telephone register corresponding
to the office or residence of the person
with whom he wishes to speak. He may now sit
down until signaled that some one at the place
called for is ready to communicate with him, or
the operator at the central office notifies him that
he can get no response from the number called
for. Besides the main central office there is a
district center in each of the principal divisions
of the city, North, West, and South, all under the
control of the former. It is not necessary for a
separate wire to run from each instrument in the
city directly to one of these centers. Several individual
wires may unite with one common wire
before reaching either the central office or a district
center.</p>

<p>1. Will you please give me some information respecting
the Alhambra? 2. For what is the city of
Munich celebrated?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Ray.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—1. The Alhambra is the fortress of
Grenada, within which is the ancient palace of
the Moorish kings. The most of it was built
between 1248 and 1354, and though defaced and
ruined, the wonderful beauty and skill of its
workmanship is still apparent. It is one of the
finest examples of Moorish architecture, remarkable
for peculiar grace and delicate elaboration.
It stands on a terraced hill north of Grenada and
overlooking the city, surrounded by a strong
wall, nearly a mile in circumference, studded
with towers. Passing through the Gate of Pomegranates
and the neglected gardens, the visitor
finds himself surrounded by beautiful arches and
open courts, all leading to the chief object of attraction,
the Moorish palace. Though severely
plain upon the exterior, within it is exquisitely
beautiful, with floors of the choicest marbles,
“fretted ceilings, partitions colored and gilt, and
filigree stuccos of veil-like transparency.” Slender
columns support the galleries, and
gracefully bending palm leaves of marble
form the arches, while beautiful
fountains are scattered here and there.
Besides the halls, courts, reception rooms, and
sleeping apartments, the building contains a
whispering gallery, a labyrinth, and vaulted
sepulchers. After the expulsion of the Moors
from Spain their conquerors took pleasure in defacing
and destroying their works of art, and the
Alhambra was remodeled and partly blocked up.
In 1812 the French blew up a portion of it, and
in 1821 it was shaken by an earthquake. Attempts
have been made to restore it, but the
sums of money contributed have been too small
to accomplish much. 2. Munich is noted for the
variety and elegance of its architecture, for its
schools of art and music, and for possessing a
larger and more valuable collection of art treasures
than any other city in Germany. Nearly all
its magnificence in architectural splendor
and elegance, sculpture, painting, and music,
date from the reign of Ludwig I., who ascended
the throne in 1825 and during his reign spent
nearly 7,000,000 thalers in the embellishment of
his capital.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—1. According to the annual report of
the Secretary of the Navy, for 1865, there were at
the outbreak of the war 7,600 men in the United
States navy, and at its close there were 51,500.
The force in the navy yards increased from 3,844
to 16,880. This latter was exclusive of about an
equal number employed in private ship yards under
contracts with the government. During the
war 208 vessels were commenced for the navy
and most of them completed; and 418 vessels
were purchased (of which 313 were steamers), at
a cost of $18,366,681.83; and of these 340 vessels
were sold during and immediately subsequent
to the war, for $5,621,800.27. 2. There
were 322 commissioned officers of the navy who
“traitorously abandoned the service” at the beginning
of the conflict.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A. H. Chase.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—A description of Washington Territory
was given in answer to another subscriber a
week ago. In Arkansas the land gradually rises
from the Mississippi westward, reaching its greatest
elevation in the Ozark Mountains. Unlike
the Eastern portion of the State, which is alluvial
in character, the country near these mountains is
high and the climate is healthful. Throughout
the State the soil along the river “bottoms” is
rich and deep, producing large crops of corn,
wheat, cotton, and tobacco. The river surface is
540 square miles, and the area covered by lakes
and ponds 265 square miles. The temperature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
varies in the southern part from 20 degrees to 94
degrees; in the north from 10 degrees to 92 degrees.
The rainfall in the south is 48-56 inches;
in the north 42 inches. Below we give the average
prices in Oregon, being unable to obtain them in
Washington Territory. In Oregon the average
price per bushel of Indian corn is 82 cents; of
wheat, 78 cents; rye, 82 cents; oats, 40 cents;
potatoes, 59 cents; hay, $12.14; horses, $56.22;
milch cows, $21.17; oxen and other cattle,
$13.72; sheep, $1.46. In Arkansas corn is 49
cents; wheat, $1.02; rye, 86 cents; oats, 53
cents; potatoes, 74 cents; hay, $11.50; cotton,
10 cents per pound; horses, $49.36; milch cows,
$14.56; oxen and other cattle, $10.11, and sheep
$1.48. 2. The effects of climate depend largely
upon individual peculiarities, but, generally
speaking, the heavy rains of Western Washington
and the malaria of Eastern Arkansas are about
equally injurious. Western Arkansas and the
Eastern part of Washington Territory are favorable
to consumptives.</p>

Thence he sailed to Cuba, where he died, at

<p>What is the oldest mine of any kind in the United
States?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">C. D. Adams.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It is generally conceded by those
who are read up in the history of mining and
metallurgy in this country that the oldest mining
enterprise of the United States, still active, is the
Mine La Motte, in the lead district of Eastern
Missouri, opened about 1720 under Renault, of
Law’s notorious Mississippi Company. It was
named after La Motte, the mineralogist of the expedition.
It has been worked at intervals ever
since it was opened, and is in successful operation
now. There are silver mines in New Mexico and
Arizona, some of which may have been opened by
the Spanish adventurers of the latter part of the
sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth.
Some of these ancient mines were operated
by the Toltecs and Aztecs years
before the Spanish invasion, but it
is not easy to identify them. So
there are copper mines in the Lake Superior
region in which the tools and mining marks of
ancient miners of pre-historic times were found
by the pioneers of the present American mining
companies. Where the first colonists of Virginia
got the ship-load of “fool’s gold” which they
sent back to England, to the great disgust of the
London company, is not certainly known; but it
is known that at the same time, in 1608, they
shipped a quantity of iron from Jamestown,
which yielded seventeen tons of metal, the first
pig iron ever made from American ore. There
are diggings in North and South Carolina and
Georgia, now overgrown with forests, which are
supposed to have been excavated by the followers
of De Soto and his immediate successors between
1539 and 1600. The first recorded account of
the discovery of coal in the United States is contained
in Hennepin’s narrative of his explorations
in the West, between 1673 and 1680, when he
saw the coal outcrop in the bluffs of the Illinois
River, not far from Ottawa and LaSalle; but coal
was first mined in the Eastern States in the beginning
of this century.</p>

John Quincy Adams, Jackson, Van Buren,
Tyler, Polk, Fillmore, Pierce, Buchanan, Lincoln,
Hayes, and Garfield were lawyers; and Arthur
was a successful legal practitioner until appointed
Collector of the Port of New York by President
Grant. Washington was a surveyor until he entered
the army. Madison was studying law when
elected to the Virginia Convention of 1776, after
which he became absorbed in political life. Monroe
studied law under Jefferson, but did not really
enter the profession, being called off into military
and political affairs. Harrison entered military
and political life early, and was kept in it most of
his days. Taylor and Grant rose to the Chief
Magistracy by distinguished military services.
Johnson was a tailor until he got
into political life. As to Congress, its membership
has been too numerous for a full investigation.
The proportions indicated below will
hold good, in all probability, for the whole of the
last or Forty-seventh Congress. The two Senators
and six of the eight Representatives from
Alabama, both Senators and three of the five
Representatives from South Carolina, one Senator
and seven of the nine Congressmen from Virginia,
both Senators and all the four Representatives of
Arkansas, in that Congress were lawyers, or, at
least, had been admitted to the bar; so were both
Senators and twelve of the nineteen Representatives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
from Illinois, the two Senators and six of
the nine Representatives from Iowa, both Senators
and eight of the eleven Representatives of
Massachusetts, one Senator and sixteen of the
thirty-three Representatives of Pennsylvania.
The South is more given to the practice of choosing
lawyers, or persons with a smattering of the
law, to represent them in Congress and the
Legislature than the North. Planters,
who never seriously expected their sons
to practice, educated them in the law
formerly, as one of the qualifications for
political life. The olden prestige of the law as
one of the learned professions, and the one that
led most directly to political promotions, had its
influence on the sons of the wealthy and their
sires, not in the South only, but in the North; nor
on them only, but on the people. There is some
rational force also in the popular conception that
lawyers are or should be peculiarly fitted to be
law-makers. The tendency in the North for some
years past, as indicated by the above statistics, is
to choose fewer lawyers and have commerce and
the great industries of the country represented by
their conspicuous leaders.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—In the summer of 1778 the beautiful
valley of Wyoming, Penn., was invaded by a
band of tories and Indians, and in the battle that
followed, on July 3, the American patriots, commanded
by Colonel Zebulon Butler, were defeated
with horrible slaughter. Then followed a
general massacre, which some escaped by fleeing
to the mountains, while a few took refuge in Fort
Forty (now Wilkesbarre). This fort was besieged
the morning of the 4th by the tories and Indians
under Colonel John Butler, and ordered to surrender;
and being without any means of defense,
Colonel Dennison yielded to the entreaties of the
women and children to enter into articles of capitulation.
It was agreed upon the surrender of
their arms, and the destruction of the fort, the
inhabitants of the valley should return peaceably
to their homes, but no sooner was the fort surrendered
than the Indians fell upon the houses,
which they plundered and burned, killing all the
women and children who had not escaped to the
mountains. The entire village of Wilkesbarre
was burned to the ground.</p>

</p>

<p>What were the “black laws” of Illinois?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">J.L. Wells.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Under the Territorial laws of Illinois
persons were allowed to bring slaves into the
Territory under the name of indentured servants.
As such they might be held in bondage for a term
of ninety-nine years or less. This was in direct
violation of the spirit of the ordinance of 1787,
which interdicted slavery or involuntary servitude
in all the territory north of the Ohio River.
The first State constitution, adopted in 1818,
prohibited the further introduction of slaves, but
did not abolish this species of slavery by liberating
the victims of the barbarous Territorial
enactments. Thus slavery existed in Illinois in
defiance of the ordinance of 1787 until the adoption
of the constitution of 1848, which contained
the following provision: “There shall
be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude
in this State, except as a punishment for
crime.” After the adoption of the constitution of
1818, the first Legislature re-enacted the wicked
law “respecting free negroes, mulattoes, servants,
and slaves” of Territorial times. No severer law
was to be found in any slave State. It forbade
negroes or mulattoes to settle in the State without
certificates of freedom. No person was to
employ any negro or mulatto without such certificate,
under a penalty of $1.50 for each day.
To harbor any slave or servant, or hinder the
owner in retaking a slave, was made a felony,
punishable by restitution or a fine of two-fold
value, and whipping not to exceed thirty stripes.
Every black or mulatto without a proper certificate
was subject to arrest as a runaway slave, to
be advertised for six weeks by the sheriff, when,
if not reclaimed or his freedom established, he
was sold for one year, after which he was entitled
to a freedom certificate. Any slave or servant
found ten miles from home without permit was
liable to arrest and thirty-five stripes, on the
order of a justice. For misbehaving to his master
or family he was punishable with the lash.
Indeed, punishment with the lash to the number
of thirty-nine and forty stripes was prescribed
for each of a long list of offenses,
real or of legal construction. Even after the
adoption of the constitution of 1848, which required
the General Assembly at its first session
to pass such laws as would effectually prohibit
free persons of color from immigrating to, or
settling in this State, and prohibit the owners of
slaves from bringing them here for the purpose of
setting them free, the Legislature passed an act,
Feb. 12, 1853, which imposed on every such
colored person a fine of $50. If the fine was not
paid forthwith, he was to be advertised and sold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
to any one who would pay the fine and costs for
the shortest period of such person’s service. A
case under this law was carried up to the Supreme
Court, and decided so late as 1864, to be valid.
Other provisions of these enactments were almost
equally detestable. Such were the infamous
“black laws” of Illinois, which were continued,
with slight modifications, from Territorial times
down to 1865, when by act of Feb.
7, of that year, they were repealed.
Had it not been for these black laws the census of
Illinois would not be blotted with an enrollment
of “168 slaves” in 1810; 917 in 1820; 747 in
1830; and 331 in 1840—the last census that carries
such a stain. Fortunately, the masters and
people at large were better than their laws. The
horrors of Southern slavery would not have been
tolerated here. During the last twenty-five years
of their existence the black laws were practically
a dead letter, being retained upon the statute
book more out of opposition to abolitionism, and
deference to the pro-slavery sentiment of the
dominant parties than for any other reason.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Stephen J. Willard.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Louis Joseph Gay-Lussac was one of
the most eminent chemists of this century. He
was born at St. Leonard, France, Dec. 6, 1778.
He distinguished himself as a student in the Polytechnic
College, Paris, and was selected to become
the assistant of the great French physicist
and chemist, Berthollet, who was so impressed
with his originality and skill in research that on
a certain occasion he exclaimed: “Young man,
it is your destiny to make discoveries. You shall
be henceforth my companion. I wish—it is a title
of which I am sure I shall have cause to be
proud—I wish to be your father
in science.” While investigating terrestrial
magnetism he was led to make a balloon ascent,
on Aug. 24, 1804, when he reached an altitude of
about 13,000 feet. Not satisfied, he procured a
greater balloon, and on Sept. 16 of the same year
rose to an altitude of 23,000 feet, a height never
before reached in a balloon, and seldom exceeded
since then. He made many valuable observations
before descending. Together with the famous
Alexander von Humboldt, he made the discovery
that hydrogen and oxygen unite in the proportions
of two of the latter to one of the former, by
bulk, to form water; also that when gases combine
with one another, either by weight or by
volume, they do so in very simple proportions, as
1 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and so on. He analyzed
many chemical compounds, proved the elementary
nature of several substances, such
as iodine, to which he gave the name
it now bears, and he formed by chemical
combinations many valuable compounds.
The French Academy elected him a member of
that distinguished body of savants; the French
Government honored him with important and
highly honorable appointments; he became a
member of the Chamber of Deputies in 1831, and
in 1839 was made a peer of the realm. He devoted
himself to scientific research to the last,
and was associated with the distinguished
scientist Arago, in the editorship of the Annals of
Chemistry and Physics. He died in 1850. 2.
Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, of Annonay,
France, a town about forty miles from Lyons,
were the inventors of hot air balloons, just one
hundred years ago, and the same year two
brothers of the name of Robert made and charged
the first hydrogen gas balloon, under the superintendence
of Mr. Charles, a professor of natural
philosophy, in Paris. 3. Sir Walter Raleigh was
executed under a trumped up charge of conspiracy
against the life of James I., of England;
but really at the instigation of certain rivals and
to gratify the king of Spain, toward whom he
had always manifested the greatest hostility.</p>

<p>There is a case in dispute here in regard to the government
survey. They say that the government surveyor
who ran the section lines here started at the
Kansas line from the wrong corner, and, running
north, made one tier of sections fifteen or twenty rods
too narrow and the next tier as much too broad. Now,
after twenty years, when the land is all occupied and
more or less improved, can the line be moved? All the
old corners are plainly defined and recognized as government
corners.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">B. F. Polhumus.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—In the case of Peder O. Aanrud (see
Copp’s Land Owner) the Commissioner of the
General Land Office made the following ruling:
“The term ‘quarter-section’ is used to designate
a certain legal subdivision of the public land ascertained
by official survey. It generally contains
just 160 acres; but, through unavoidable
inaccuracy of surveys in adjusting meridians
etc., it often exceeds or falls below that amount.
It is still, however, the technical legal quarter
section defined by law and ascertained
by official survey. A homestead settler
may enter 160 acres in legal
subdivisions lying contiguous to each other without
reference to the quarter-section lines, or he
may enter a technical quarter-section as such, in
which case he can take the amount of land contained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
therein, as shown by the official survey.
In entering a quarter section he cannot depart
from the ascertained lines, but must take 160
acres, more or less, as the case may be.” The
case stated in this question is extraordinary, and
may not be fully covered by the above ruling, but
it is almost certain that in all cases where patents
have issued and owners have been in undisturbed
possession for sixteen years or more the titles
cannot be disturbed.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—He was a politician of the desperado

Ky., in 1807, he removed to Missouri in 1830.
In 1841 he was appointed by the Governor to fill an
unexpired term in the United States Senate, of
which, through re-election, he continued a member
until 1855. For some time he acted with the Benton
wing of the Democratic party, which accepted
the Jacksonian doctrine as opposed to pro-slavery
radicalism. In time, however, he adopted Calhounism,
including the doctrine of secession, and
during the early Kansas troubles devoted himself
to making Kansas a slave State. In 1854-56 he
encouraged and abetted the outrages committed
by the bands of Missouri border ruffians, who repeatedly
invaded that Territory, taking an active
part in driving free-soil voters from the polls and
instigating the bloody attacks on Lawrence and
Ossawatamie, and in other villainies of those terrible
times preceding the triumph of the Free
State party in Kansas.</p>

<span class="smcap">J. W. Johnson.</span><br>
</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—During the ten years from 1869 to
1879 the average annual rainfall in that part of
Nebraska lying between the Missouri River and a
line drawn to where Blue River crosses the Kansas-Nebraska
Line, was thirty-eight inches. In
the extreme southeastern corner of the State,
near the Missouri River, it was nearly forty
inches. West of the line above described to a
line starting from the Missouri River a little south
of the mouth of Bow River, running with a slight
eastern curve to Kearney and then southwesterly
to the State line, the average rainfall was
thirty-two inches. From this last line to another
starting near the mouth of the
Niobrara, curving southwesterly to a point
a little east of North Platte, and
thence curving slightly to the southwest
to a point a little west of Culbertson, the rainfall
averaged twenty-six inches. Between this
last line and another starting on the State line at
the mouth of the Keya Paha and running southwesterly
to a point on the Kansas-Nebraska line,
midway between Culbertson and the southwest
corner of the State, the average was nineteen
inches. West of this section the rainfall is not
well determined, but it diminishes from nineteen
to less than seventeen inches. The heaviest rainfall
is in June.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Bachelor.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Among the old Greek legends is one
that near the island of Caprera, in the Mediterranean
Sea, there dwelt two—some versions say
three—damsels whose music was so sweet that no
one who heard it could resist its seductive charms.
The passing sailor, listening to it, forgot his
country, home, and all former friends, and, unable
to escape the entrancement of their songs,
remained on the barren rocks until he died of
starvation. It is further related that Ulysses,
one of the most crafty of the Greek heroes of the
olden time, by the advice of Circe, filled his sailors’
ears with wax before passing the rock and
had them lash him to the mast until the danger
was passed. When he heard the music he struggled
hard to free himself and escape to the rock,
but his companions only bound him the more
firmly until their ship had passed out of hearing,
whereupon the fated sisters hurled themselves
into the deep and were changed into two great
rocks. The whole legend may be regarded as an
allegory, the sirens personifying seductive pleasures.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Freemason.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Answer.—The “Five Points” in the confession
of the Synod of Dort, generally regarded as the
essentials of Calvinism, are the following doctrines:
1. Predestination; 2. The atonement; 3.
The total depravity of the natural man; 4. That
salvation is purely of the grace and free will of
God; 5. The final perseverance of all who have
once experienced justification by faith. For a
more extended presentation of these five points
see Our Curiosity Shop for 1881, page 91. These
doctrines are differently construed by Presbyterian
divines; so that in fact they are held in
quite different senses by organizations usually
classed together as Calvinists. The Pan-Presbyterian
Council recognized the rights of the several
bodies represented in it to construe the Scriptures
as regards these doctrines according to their own
judgments so long as they subscribed to the general
declarations of the Westminster Confession
of Faith, or the confession of the Synod of Dort.</p>

commuted to a year’s imprisonment. Upon his

<p><em>Answer.</em>—To find the day of the week on
which any particular date of the current year will
fall, divide the whole number of days from the
time when computation is made by 7. If there is
no remainder the day sought will be the same
day of the week as the day when the computation
is made. If there is a remainder of one it is
the next day of the week, and so on. Illustration:
Suppose it is Monday, July 9, and the question
is, what day of the week will Aug. 10 be,
proceed as follows: In July after July 9 there are
22 days. Add 10 days in August, making 32
days. Divide 32 by 7, and the quotient is 4 and
4 remainder. Now July 9 was Monday, so Aug.
10 will be the fourth day of the week after Monday,

dates in other years than the current one is a
much more serious matter. It involves many

<p>What States, if any, require persons to support
their pauper parents and other near relatives?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">C. Watson Brown.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The statutes of Illinois require “that
every poor person who shall be unable to earn a
livelihood in consequence of any bodily infirmity,
idiocy, lunacy, or other unavoidable cause, shall
be supported by the father, grandfather, mother,
grandmother, children, grandchildren, brothers
or sisters of such person, if they, or either of
them, be of sufficient ability; provided that when
persons become paupers from intemperance or
other bad conduct they shall not be entitled to
support from any relative except parent or child.”
These relatives are to be called on in the following
order: Children are to be first called on for
parents, if the children are of sufficient ability,
and, if not, then the parents of the poor person;
next brothers and sisters; next grandchildren;
next grandparents. Married females cannot be
required to support their poor relatives unless
they have property in their own right. Similar
laws exist in most if not all the other States
of the Union. Not having the statutes of Colorado
at hand, we must refer you to them, at the nearest
justice’s office or at the county court house, for

<p>In a recent answer in Our Curiosity Shop it was
asserted that “a section of the Northern Cross
Railroad, from Naples to Springfield, was the first
railroad in this State; also, that it was operated
by mule power until 1849.” Now let me say: 1.
That the road was built from Meredosia toward
Jacksonville and Springfield in 1838. [It was begun
in 1837, and was opened through to Springfield
in 1838—Editor.] 2. A locomotive was
shipped by way of the rivers to Meredosia, where
it arrived and was placed on the track in November,
1838. I went from Peoria, June 15, 1839, by
steamboat to Meredosia, where I saw the locomotive
on the new railroad, coupled to a train of
cars ready to pull out. A few years later there
was a branch constructed from the bluff, four or
five miles from Meredosia, to Naples. The road
from Naples to Jacksonville and Springfield became
the main line, and the spur to Meredosia
was regarded as the branch. [The use of steam
was very soon abandoned, as the road was operated
at a loss, and mule power was resorted to
until 1849—Editor.]</p>

For many years they lived upon the Gaboon

New York, he returned to Western Africa, where
he devoted four years to travel and discovery.
During this time he traveled about 8,000 miles on
foot, and collected many valuable specimens in
natural history. His works contain the result of
his study during this and a later expedition, their
chief interest and value being due to the account
they contain of many hitherto strange tribes, and
to his description of the gorilla and many curious
apes. Du Chaillu was born in France about 1820.
His name is pronounced Du Sha-yu, with accent

<p>Has Congress changed the internal revenue laws so
as to allow the producer to sell to the consumer?</p>

<p class="right">
A. N. W.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Yes, within a narrow limit: as shown
by the following communication from Mr. Milton
C. Springer, the efficient and obliging Chief
Deputy Internal Revenue Collector of this district,
showing changes in the law relating to the
sale of leaf tobacco by the producer:</p>

<p>“The law (see section 3.244, United States Revised
Statutes, paragraph 7) defines a retail dealer
in leaf tobacco as a person whose business it is to
sell leaf tobacco in quantities less than an original
hogshead, case, or bale; or who sells directly
to consumers; or to persons other than dealers in
leaf tobacco, who have paid a special tax as such,
or to manufacturers of tobacco, snuff, or cigars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
who have paid a special tax, or to persons who
purchase in original packages for export.</p>

<p>“Section 2 of the act of March 3, 1883, provides
that on and after May 1, retail dealers in leaf tobacco
shall pay two hundred and fifty dollars
($250), and thirty cents for each additional
dollar on the amount of their monthly
sales, in excess of the rate of five hundred
dollars ($500) per annum. Provided
that farmers and producers of tobacco may
sell at the place of production tobacco of their
own growth and raising, at retail directly to consumers
to an amount not exceeding $100 annually.
This proviso, as in the case of all provisos
to general provisions of law, must be construed
literally:</p>

<p>“1. The sales must be made at the place of production.</p>

<p>“2. They must be made strictly to consumers
and to no other persons.</p>

<p>“3. The tobacco must be of the growth and raising
of the farmer or producer who makes the
sales.</p>

<p>“4. The sales must be of leaf tobacco in the form
and condition of leaf as it is ordinarily dried and
cured for the market. If the tobacco is ‘twisted
by hand or reduced into a condition to be consumed,
or in any manner other than the ordinary
mode of drying and curing prepared for sale or
consumption, even if prepared without the use of
any machine or instrument and without being
pressed or sweetened,’ it is liable to a tax of 8
cents a pound. (See section 14, act of March 1,
1879).</p>

<p>“5. If the farmer or producer sells ordinary leaf
at retail directly to consumers, as hereinbefore
stated, to an amount exceeding $100 annually,
he becomes liable to pay a special tax as retail
dealer in leaf tobacco. He also becomes liable if
he violates any of the conditions of the said proviso,
as herein stated.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="smcap">Osborne City</span>, Kan.<br>
</p>

<p>1. How should a rain-gauge be set in order to register
rainfall correctly? 2. At what hours per day are
the observations of thermometer taken to get a mean
temperature?</p>

<p class="right">
S. B. F.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There are different kinds of rain-gauges,
and instructions for using accompany
each instrument. As a rule the mouth of a rain-gauge
is larger than the graduated chamber which
measures the fall. For special observations different
forms of gauges are used, horizontal, inclined,
or vertical. For ordinary observations the
mouth of the instrument should be horizontal.
Instructions of the United States Signal Service
direct observers to set the rain-gauge “whenever
practicable, with the top of the funnel-shaped collector
twelve inches above the surface of the
ground, firmly fixed in a vertical position. When
a position at the level of the ground cannot be
found with a sufficiently clear exposure, the gauge
will be placed on the top of the instrument-room
or roof of the building occupied by the observer,
who will measure the height above the ground
and report it to the Chief Signal Officer.
The measuring-rod is graduated in inches
and tenths of an inch, and the
proportion between the cylinder and funnel is as
ten to one, so that ten inches upon the rod correspond
to one inch of actual rainfall.” “Snow
will be melted and measured, and reported in
the same manner as rain. If for any reason it
cannot be melted, the depth will be measured,
and ten inches of snow reported as one inch of
rainfall.” There is a great difference in measure
of rain at several elevations above the ground,
not wholly explainable. Professor Phillips found
the fall of rain at York, England, for the year
1833-34 to be 14.16 inches at 213 feet from the
ground; 19.85 inches at 44 feet; and 25.71 on
the ground. Daily mean relative humidity observations,
according to the United States Signal
Service, are obtained by dividing 7 a. m., 2 p. m.,
and 9 p. m. observations by three; the monthly
means by dividing the sum of the daily means by
the number of the days in the month. 2. The
daily mean temperature is obtained by dividing
the sum of the 7 a. m., 2 p. m., and twice the 9
p. m. observations by four.</p>

<p>When a rain-gauge is not at hand, a perfectly
cylindrical pan or tub may be used to measure
the rainfall, but it should be elevated at least a
foot above the level lawn or roof.</p>

a greater love of the beautiful and raising the
common standard of architecture and home surroundings
in rural life. He protested against

the tenth of his private fortune, to promote the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>

Grand Master. The workingmen responded but

<p class="right">

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It was long believed, and is still generally
supposed, that, after Lewis and Clarke,
General John C. Fremont, then a Captain of
Engineers in the United States Army, with a
small force, guided by the famous Kit Carson,
was the first explorer who crossed the continent
within the present boundaries of the United
States. This he did in 1843, following much of
the way the route afterward adopted by the
Union and Central Pacific Railroads. However,
Mr. William E. Curtis, in his intensely interesting
little book entitled “A Summer Scamper Along
the Old Santa Fe Trail, and Through the Gorges to
Zion,” shows conclusively that, while the world
is indebted to Fremont for the first maps and
published descriptions of the country between
Central Colorado and the California coast, hunters
and trappers had wound their way through
these savage wilds years before him, and that as
early as Jan. 20, 1824, a bold adventurer by the
name of Sylvester Pattie, a Virginian, and his
son, with a party of five other men, left the Missouri
River in company with a trading party for
Santa Fe, and some three years later groped his
way down the Gila River into California;
where he visited San Francisco,
then an insignificant Mexican trading
post and Jesuit mission station. Arrested as
spies by the jealous Mexicans, and imprisoned, it
was some time before these daring adventurers
obtained their release and secured a passage from
San Diego to Vera Cruz, whence they got back to
the United States. “The Summer Scamper” and
another book by the same author, “Children of
the Sun,” both by The Inter Ocean Publishing
Company, are full of spirited sketches of the
early explorers of the Southwest, graphic descriptions
of the scenery of this wonderful region, and
observations on its natural resources and the
progress of the civilization which is invading it
from all directions.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—David Livingstone was a Scotchman,
born in Lanarkshire in 1817, and when a boy
worked in a cotton factory. In 1840 he landed in
Port Natal, Africa, as a medical missionary of the
London Missionary Society, and became an associate
of the Rev. Robert Moffat, whose daughter
he afterward married. For sixteen years he
labored earnestly in the mission work, and during
that time discovered Lake Ngami (1849), and
crossed the continent from the Zambesi to Loando,
a journey which occupied eighteen months.
While in England, in 1857, Livingstone published
his “Missionary Travels and Researches in
South Africa.” Returning to Africa he devoted
himself to exploration, and in 1865 resolved to
find the source of the Nile. During the remainder
of his life he was often not heard from for months,
and it was during one of these protracted absences
that Mr. Stanley began his travels to
search for him, and found him in great destitution
at Ujiji. Dr. Livingstone died while exploring
the river system of the Chambeze in the belief
that these were the head waters of the Nile, having
reached Ulala, beyond Lake Bemba, in 1873.
In 1874 his body was interred in Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p>1. In subdividing a township into sections, to what
part of the township do the fractional sections belong?
2. Sections sometimes overrun or fall short in the subdivision
of quarter sections into “forties” by the
County Surveyor: Is this overplus or deficit divided
equally among the “forties,” or is it all thrown into
one side?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Charles Owens.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—1. The sections on the northern and
western boundaries of a township are fractional—i. e.,
they do not contain exactly 640 acres. The
small fragments of these fractional sections are
called “lots,” and they are numbered from 1 upward
in each section. 2. The course that surveyors
are directed by the regulations of the General
Land Office to pursue in the subdivision of sections
is to run straight lines from the quarter section
corners established by the United States survey
to the opposite corresponding corners, and
the point of intersection of lines so run will be the
common corner to the several quarter sections,
or, in other words, the legal center of the section.
In the subdivision of fractional sections, where
no opposite corresponding corners have been or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
can be fixed, the subdivision lines should be ascertained
by running from the established corners
due north, south, east, or west lines, as the case
may be, to the water-course, Indian boundary
line, or other external boundary of such fractional
section. Where the lines marked in the
field by the United States Deputy Surveyors are
not due north and south or east and west lines,
“mean courses” must be adopted. Where there
is no opposite section line the subdivision line
must be run parallel to the section line that is
marked. The purpose is to divide the overplus or
deficit arising from the unavoidable irregularities
and errors of the United States survey as
nearly equal as possible among the minor subdivisions
of the section.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">H. G. Clayton.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The use of tea among the Chinese,
from whom it has extended to all parts of the
world, cannot be traced with certainty further
back than to 350 A. D., or thereabouts. This use
did not become general in China until about A. D.
800. It was first introduced into Europe by the
Dutch in 1610. How long coffee has been used
in Arabia, its native country, is not certainly
known. It was introduced into Egypt in the sixteenth
century. The first coffee house in Europe
was established in Constantinople in 1551. The
first person to make it known to Western Europe
seems to have been Leonhard Rauwolf, a German
physician, a great traveler. Once introduced, the
use of this delightful beverage extended rapidly.
Coffee houses sprung up in all the chief cities.
The first one in London was opened by a Greek in
Newman’s court, Cornhill, in 1652; the first one
in France was opened in Marseilles in 1671; the
first one in Paris in 1672. The earliest manufacture
of whisky is generally referred to the
middle of the sixteenth century, but there are
some reasons for believing that it had an earlier
origin. It was made by the Gaels from barley,
which still yields the best quality, and was called
by them <em>uisge beatha</em>, later <em>usque baugh</em>, <em>the
water of life</em>—of which first word “whisky” is a
corruption.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Wm. Marshall.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—No doubt it is sound policy to make
use of convict labor for the public good and the
improvement of the criminals themselves, but
the real question is, How is this to be done?
Manufacturers and honest mechanics complain
that the present system of hiring out convicts to
contractors puts the labor of the untaxed criminals,
housed at the expense of the State, without
families to support, and free from all social and
civil burdens, in unfair competition with the
labor or industrial products of honest workmen
who have families to maintain, taxes to pay, and
social and civil duties to perform. Whether the
contract system can be so adjusted as to remove
any just ground of complaint of the nature
here pointed out is a question that is eliciting the
earnest study of some of our most profound social
and political economists. We cannot discuss it
in this place, nor have we any dictum to proclaim.
It must be said for the system that it is the
only one, with few, if any, exceptions, that has

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The mushroom spawn is sold in

Procure a quantity of good horse dung and
make it into a heap, which must be frequently
turned for a fortnight, until the rankness has disappeared.
Then build it into beds twelve inches
in height and four feet wide, under a shed ten
feet wide. This will allow room for a walk
through the center of the shed. Pack the dung
tightly, and cover it with long straw for ten days,
when the straw must be removed and an inch of
fine loam spread upon the beds. On this plant
the spawn, which has been broken into pieces the
size of a walnut, in rows six inches apart, and
cover with another inch of mold, over which
spread the straw. When the mold is too dry
sprinkle it with tepid water. In five or six weeks
the young mushrooms should appear.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The “Battle of the Pyramids” was
fought at Embabeh, opposite Cairo, Egypt, July
21, 1798, between the French, commanded by
Napoleon Bonaparte, and the Egyptian Mamelukes,
commanded by Murad Bey. The latter
fought with desperate valor, but they were completely
bewildered by European tactics. The
French infantry, formed into squares, received
the fierce charges of the magnificent Mameluke
cavalry, which swarmed around them, on their
serried bayonets, while a galling fire of grape and
musketry virtually annihilated whole divisions
of their army. Out of an army of over 60,000
men Murad Bey escaped with barely 2,500 horse,
leaving 15,000 men on the field of battle and the
rest of his troops, their arms abandoned, fleeing

<span class="smcap">Adeline Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—State laws require railway companies
to use certain precautions against fire from
locomotive sparks or coals from ash pan. If it
can be shown that damage to property has resulted
from neglect of these laws or through culpability
of railway employes, the company is responsible.
The spark extinguishers on locomotive
smoke stacks check the draft and on this account
engines frequently run considerable distances
with them uncovered. Again they often
dump panfuls of live coals on the track, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
the prairie grass and stubble are like tinder and
the wind is blowing a gale. Damage done through
such culpability is fairly chargeable to the railway
companies, and, if the facts can be proved, they
can be made to pay the loss.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">F. R. Smith.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The method of sinking cylinders by
use of compressed air was invented by Mr. Triger,
of England, in 1841, but has been carried to
greater results in the United States than anywhere
else. Tubular cast-iron shells are used to
form a large hollow pile, which may be forced
downward by its own weight and superincumbent
masonry built on it as it descends. Compressed
air is employed inside such shells to force
the water out at the bottom, where the pile or
caisson is open, while it is air-tight and water-tight
at all other points. It was formerly supposed
men could not work under a pressure of
more than three atmospheres, which is required
in most cases to keep out water at a depth of
sixty-five feet, but in the case of the St. Louis
bridge, caissons were sunk a depth of 110 feet below
the surface. So, in the case of sinking the
Brooklyn bridge piers, the men at work in the
compressed air chamber, excavating the earth as
the pier descended, worked in an atmosphere
from three to four times as heavy as in the open
air; a strain which they could endure but a short
while at a time, and which proved fatal in many
instances.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Flora K. Smith.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Each of the States has its own laws
in regard to the rights of aliens. In Iowa aliens,
that is persons of foreign birth who have not
been naturalized by their own act or that of their
parents, may acquire, inherit, hold, and dispose
of property, real or personal, precisely as if they
were citizens. The same is true in most of the
States. In Pennsylvania alien friends may buy
lands not exceeding 5,000 acres, nor in net
annual income $20,000, and hold the same as
citizens may, but there are certain differences between
them and citizens in the matter of real
estate conveyances, inheritance, etc. A will prevents
the property of an alien from escheating to
the State in case of non-appearance of heirs; and,
as in the case of citizens, transcends the statute
and common law as to the division of property
among the heirs of persons who die intestate, i. e.
without testamentary wills.</p>

<p>Is there anything to prevent a person from locating

they worth?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">James M. Selders.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Military bounty land warrants are
issued by the Commissioner of Pensions for services
in the several wars before the
year 1855. No warrants are issued for
services during the war for the Union; but soldiers
can be credited on homestead entries for
the terms of their enlistments, up to four years
of the time of residence required as a condition
of title in cases of ordinary homesteaders. These
warrants call for 40, 60, 80, 120, or 160 acres of
land, as the case may be, and being assignable
can be located by any purchaser. They should
be bought only of responsible dealers, with a
written guarantee that, in case of error or defect,
the settler will not lose anything thereby. The
market price of such warrants is from $1
to $1.20 per acre. There is no reason
why these cannot be used in paying for public
lands in Oregon as well as in other States or
Territories. Applications must be made as in
cash cases, but accompanied with a warrant duly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
assigned as payment for the land. Yet
where the land is $2.50 per acre, as the warrant
pays only for land at $1.25 per acre, the remaining
$1.25 per acre must be paid in cash. However,
a tract of eighty acres, rated at $2.50 per
acre, for example, can be paid for by two eighty-acre
warrants without any cash, except fees
chargeable by land officers, as follows: For a
forty-acre tract, 50 cents each to Register and
Receiver; for sixty acres, 75 cents each; for eighty
acres, $1; and so on.</p>

<p>Having noticed in Our Curiosity Shop what is
said in regard to the surname of the Queen
of England, I send you the following extract from
the <cite>Whitehall Review</cite> on this subject: “At
dinner the other night the conversation lapsed,
as it sometimes will lapse with the best, into
questions hardly distinguishable from conundrums.
A celebrated historian was present, and
I put a question to him which I know has
puzzled a great many people at different times:
‘What is the surname of the royal family?’
‘Guelph, of course.’ That is the usual answer,
and it was the historian’s. I ventured to
suggest that although the royal family
are Guelphs by descent, her Majesty’s
marriage with Prince Albert of Saxe-Cobourg
must have the effect which the marriage of a
lady has in all other cases, and that the surname
of the present house must be the Prince Consort’s.
But what is the surname of the Prince
Consort’s family? Simple, but staggering. No
one knew. All guessed, and all were wrong. I
happened to have looked up the subject a few
months ago, so I knew that the name was ‘Wettin.’
Of course no one had heard it before.
Every one smiled at the horrible idea of the
Guelphs being reduced to Wettins! The point
was referred to Theodore Martin. ‘You are quite
right,’ said the graceful biographer of the Prince
Consort. ‘Wettin is the family name of the
house of Saxony, to whom the dominion of
Saxony in the year 1420. The king of Saxony and
the minor princes of the house are, therefore, all
Wettins; or, German, Wettiner.’” [Nevertheless,
the fact remains that none of the royal family
sign either of the names, Guelph or Wettin, or
are addressed by either name in any form of address,
oral or written.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</p>

<p>Seeing that the earth’s diameter at the equator is
greater than at the poles, and Lake Itasca is nearer the
center of the earth than the surface of the Gulf of Mexico,
why isn’t it proper to say that the Mississippi
River runs up hill?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Harry.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—This notion that the Mississippi, in
order to accommodate itself to theories as to the
shape of the earth, is performing the remarkable
feat of running up hill, is sufficiently prevalent to
lead to the iteration and reiteration of the above
question as often as once a week at least. Of
course we cannot reiterate answers so frequently,
and hence generally pass the question unnoticed,
as correspondents have passed our by-gone replies.
A lengthy answer will be found in Our
Curiosity Shop of last year, page 95. Here and
now we will merely say that the United States
Hydrographical Survey flatly contradicts the notion
that Lake Itasca is lower than the Gulf of
Mexico. It gives the levels at numerous points
between that lake and the mouth of the Mississippi,
and, surprising as it may seem, considering
that the equator has “got the bulge”
on all the rest of the world, this survey
demonstrates that this old-fashioned river,
following the custom of other rivers, with unyielding
perversity, is running down hill; in some
places at the rate of twenty-five feet and more
per mile, and in others at the rate of only several
inches. Perhaps this all comes of its never having
been “to high school,” or a gymnasium. In
fact its education has been totally neglected, except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
down South, where it has been trained into a
bad habit of climbing levees. Whatever the shape
of the earth—whether its equatorial diameter is
twenty-six miles greater than its axial diameter,
or more or less; and whether the waters of the
ocean are or are not drawn toward the equator
by the centrifugal force of the earth’s diurnal
motion, until they stand several miles higher
there than they would if the globe had
no diurnal motion—one fact is established
beyond all equivocation, and that
is, that tide level at the mouth of the Mississippi
is about 1,575 feet lower than Lake Itasca; which
entirely relieves this grand old son of Neptune of
any necessity for waging war with the laws of
nature and fighting his way up hill to revisit the
halls of his father, the “Trident-bearer,” in
the briny chambers of the sea. Probably if the
earth’s motion on its axis were to cease there
would be a reflux of waters from the equatorial
region into the Gulf of Mexico, up the Mississippi
Valley, across into the Red River of the
North and the Mackenzie, submerging the greater
part of North America. Let us hope that the
earth will continue to spin on its axis at about the
same rate as now, at least until we have sold out
all our farms and corner lots and moved to equatorial
America, where land will then be considerably
higher than it is at present in more senses
than one.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Ford A. Carpenter.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The original harmonica consisted of
drinking glasses, played with moistened fingers.
We read that about 1750 Mr. Packeridge, an
Irish gentleman, was noted as a player upon
glasses, whose pitch was regulated by the amount
of water contained in each. Benjamin Franklin
greatly improved the harmonica by making the
glasses revolve about a spindle and fixing the
pitch by the size of the glass. He also adopted a
different color for each note in the scale, and
moistened the rims by passing them through
water. Miss Davis, a relative of Franklin, became
a celebrated harmonica player, and performed
at concerts with great credit. The mouth
organ, which is now commonly called the harmonica,
is a toy in which the sounds are produced
by the vibration of metallic reeds, moved
by the breath. Reed instruments essentially
similar have been in use in China, Germany, and
Holland from very early times. The inventor is
unknown.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Indians in Oregon and Washington
Territory are all gathered into reservations,
and are now peaceable. They are not so
fierce and restless as the tribes on this side of the
Rockies, being more inclined to pastoral life,
farming, and fishing. Little trouble is to be apprehended
from this source, particularly in Oregon,
the Indian population of which is not large.
There are great bodies of public lands. The railroad
land-grants are not so extensive as in the
Missouri Valley States. There are immense quantities
of fine timber lands open to purchase at the
minimum price of $2.50 per acre under the
“timber lands act” of June 3, 1878, which applies
only to such lands in Oregon, Washington
Territory, California, and Nevada. There are
also wide sections in these States
for sale at 25 cents an acre under
the “desert lands” act of March 3, 1877.
Great bargains have been made in lands passed
under this description which are capable of easy
irrigation, and are then remarkably productive.
Oregon is divided into two parts, differing essentially
in climate and productions by the Cascade
Range of mountains, running nearly parallel with
the Pacific coast, with an average breadth of 50
to 60 miles, and an average elevation of 8,000
feet. The portion of the State west of this range,
constituting about one-third of its total area, is
well watered, is generally very fertile, and, for
the most part, covered with forests of valuable
timber. The eastern two-thirds of the State,
with the exception of the broad, fertile valleys of
the Colombia and Wallawalla Rivers, is mainly
made up of elevated plains, with insufficient
rainfall for agriculture, except in districts where
artificial irrigation is practicable.</p>

<p>The description of Washington Territory corresponds
in the main with that of Oregon. The
Territory is similarly divided, as regards climate
and productions, by the Cascade Range. The
rainfall is even greater in the western portion of
Washington Territory than in the corresponding
portion of Oregon, ranging from 70 inches in the
south to the remarkable measure of 125 inches
in the north, where it borders on Puget
Sound. In this same region the temperature
is remarkably equable, varying but 27 degrees
during the year between the lowest and
highest points. East of the Cascades a narrow
strip on the north is mountainous and covered
with forests, but south of this lies the Great Plain
of the Columbia. Along the western border of
this vast region, next the Cascade Range, it is
claimed that the rainfall is sufficient for good
cereal crops. The same is asserted of its eastern
edge, bordering the Coeur d’Alene Mountains of
Idaho; but the rest of it, like the southern extension
of the same plain into Oregon, is fit only for
grazing, except where irrigation is possible. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
resembles very much the western portions of Kansas
and Nebraska and the western parts of Colorado
and Wyoming. In both regions the nutritious,
self-curing bunch grasses, which form the
chief reliance of the herdsmen east of the Rockies,
abound. The grazing and agricultural interests
of Oregon and Washington are increasing with
great rapidity. The census of 1880 credits Oregon
with 500,000 cattle and 1,250,000 sheep,
and Washington with 250,000 cattle and 200,000
sheep, and since then the increase has been nearly
100 per-cent. The wheat crop of Oregon, according
to the census, was 7,480,010 bushels, the
oat crop 4,385,650 bushels, and the barley crop
920,977 bushels. At the same time in Washington
Territory the wheat crop was 1,921,322 bushels,
the oat crop 1,571,706, and the barley crop
566,537 bushels. Undoubtedly the completion
of the Northern Pacific Railroad this year will
open an era of marvelous growth in the State
and Territory above described.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—He was an English political writer of
the latter part of the last and the first third of
the present century. Born at Farnham, Eng., in
1762, the son of a farmer of moderate means, he
acquired habits of industry and self-dependence.
Not liking rural pursuits, he went to London and
engaged as a copying clerk. Soon tiring of this
occupation, he enlisted in the British army,
where he rose by merit to the rank of Sergeant
Major. His spare time in barracks was given to
self-education, and on obtaining his discharge, in
1791, he married and emigrated to Philadelphia,
where he entered upon his after career as a political
writer under the pseudonym of “Peter
Porcupine.” At this period he satirized American
democracy and French republicanism, attacking
the inconsistencies and political
fallacies of the time in terms of scorn
and bitter denunciation. He was denounced
by the American press, particularly
by the Democrats, or “Republicans” of
those times, as a Tory aiming at reviving the
royalistic element in this country, not then completely
eradicated. Not pleased with the reception
of his political diatribes he returned in
1800 to England, and in 1802 began the publication
of his <cite>Weekly Political Register</cite>, now
famous, which he continued to his death, June
18, 1835. At first Tory, the <cite>Register</cite> gradually
changed its politics until it became the most fierce
and unrelenting opponent of the government,
then conducted by Pitt, and the foremost
champion of English Radicalism. He advocated
the abolition of flogging in the army, and for
strictures on the government and satires and
charges claimed to be libellous against certain high
officials, he was condemned to imprisonment for
two years in Newgate Prison, and to pay a fine
of £1,000. He attacked the six acts of the British
Parliament for the suppression of free discussion,
pouring vials of abuse on the leaders of the
government party; and to escape pecuniary embarrassments
and the dread of again going to
Newgate, he once more came to America, where
his change of politics had raised up many friends.
He virtually edited his <cite>Weekly Political Register</cite>
from this side the Atlantic until some years later
when he returned to England. Radicalism had
made great strides, and he found himself one of
its recognized champions. In 1829-30 he delivered
political lectures in several of the principal
towns of England and Scotland, and was everywhere
met with enthusiastic welcome as the
boldest and most powerful advocate of the people’s
rights. In 1832 he was elected to the first reformed
Parliament as the member for Oldham.
He was re-elected in 1834, and continued in this
relation until his death the following year. Among
his many popular works may be named “Cottage
Economy,” “Rural Riches,” “Advice to Young
Men and Women,” “The Emigrant’s Guide,”
“Parliamentary History,” and an “English Grammar.”</p>

<p>Please describe the method of building houses with
concrete walls. What should be used to make the
concrete, and in what proportions? Will common
lime answer, or must Portland cement or water lime
be used? The former comes high here.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Wm. M. Fisk.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—For the foundation, especially in
sandy or wet soils, it is best to use water lime, or
a mixture of Portland cement or water lime and
quick lime in the proportions of two shovelfuls
of the former and one of quick lime putty
to fourteen of fine gravel (or fine and coarse
mixed) and one of coarse sand. Above the ground
or embankment use quick lime in the proportions
of one shovelful of lime putty to six or eight of
gravel sand. The proportions depend on the
strength of the lime, which varies according to
the quality of the stone from which it is made.
Slake the quick lime into putty ready for use,
mix it partially with the gravel, and only add the
water lime at the last moment before filling the
barrow or hod. For the foundation dig a
ditch of the proper size and dump the
concrete into it. Cover it and give it
a couple of days to set and harden before starting
the upper walls. Take fence boards for mold
boards; make clamps of three-quarter inch
strips, tapering from two inches to one and one-half
inches, so as to drive out of the wall easily
before the concrete is hard; bore a half-inch hole in
each and two inches further apart than the thickness
of the wall, and make half-inch pegs four
inches long for these holes. Set one tier of these
molds on top of the foundation all around, resting
on clamps at distances of five to six feet, and
with as many clamps on upper edge to gauge the
molds. Now shovel or dump in the fresh concrete
as fast as you can mix it. If the weather is fine
you can set a second tier of molds on top of
the first, twenty-four hours, or even eight
hours, after the first were filled, and fill in at the
same rate as before, provided you leave the first
molds undisturbed. As soon as the second tier is
filled, draw the pegs from the taper ends of the
lowest tier of clamps and drive them out. Remove
the lower set of mold boards and begin a
third tier at once. Leave the holes left by clamps,
for the air to circulate through. A foot wall for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
first story and ten-inch above that, with eight-inch
for partitions, will make a good strong
building. The outside should have a coat of
plaster made of medium fine sand, mixed with
equal portions of quick lime and water lime; and
this plaster should be marked out, before it becomes
fully hardened, into blocks, to resemble
stonework. As concrete houses, like brick ones,
are apt to be damp if plastered directly
on the walls, it is best to run in small
blocks or strips sixteen inches from center
to center, on top of every third or fourth course,
before filling the molds with concrete, keep
these flush with the inside of walls. Nail inch
strips to these blocks to serve for scantling, and
lath and plaster over this “furring,” as it is
called, and you will have dry walls. Have window
and door frames ready to build in as you go;
securing them by blocks nailed to jambs, around
which pack the concrete to hold them firm.
Level up the course of concrete when you reach
the height for the first joists, and lay an inch
board four inches wide on concrete to rest
joists on. Have ends of joists that enter wall cut
beveling, so that in case the inside of building
burns the joists will drop without prying the
walls down. Set joists, leveling them carefully,
and go on building wall as before. A concrete
house built in this way is as substantial as brick.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Las Vegas hot springs are reputed
to be highly beneficial in cases of chronic
and inflammatory rheumatism; particularly in
the latter. They are situated on the New Mexico
line of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad,
770 miles from Kansas City, which makes
them 1,259 miles from Chicago, via the Chicago

claimed also that these springs are of great benefit
to patients suffering with blood-poisons,

the mountain streams the fishing is good, and
game is plenty in neighboring localities. From
this point to Santa Fe, sixty-five miles, the railroad

<p>Is the basket willow marketable in the United States
at rates that pay for cultivating it? If so, how is it
cultivated, and what soil is best suited for it.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">I. H. Davis.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Repeated efforts have been made to
cultivate the osier, or basket willow, in the United
States, but the labor of peeling and preparing it
for the market costs so much more here than in
Europe, where this work is done by women and
children at trivial wages, that it has been found
difficult to compete with the imported stock.
The annual importation of prepared willow during
the ten years ending in 1879 averaged $33,000,
and the willow-work $170,000 a year. The
soils best adapted for the osier are rich alluvions
and reclaimed swamps. If liable to overflow in
spring floods, the ground should have drainage
ditches. It is well to have means of irrigating the
land in very dry weather. It is propagated from
cuttings, selected from the wood grown the year
before, cut smoothly into lengths of about ten
inches, thrust into soil butt-end first, so as to
leave only about an inch above ground. Care must
be taken not to peel the bark in setting these
slips, and for this reason it is sometimes best to
use a hard wood or iron rod to make the hole.
They should slope at an angle of 45 degrees
toward the north. It is best to plant in straight
rows from 20 to 28 inches apart, according to
whether they are to be cut every year or every
other year, and at intervals of six or eight inches.
It is sometimes preferable to set in trenches, and,
if the soil is poor, to fertilize with leaf-mold,
stable manure, or bonedust, and irrigate with the
soakings of manure during dry weather. The
ground should be kept mellow and well weeded.
The time of cutting should be late in the fall or in
winter. The rods should be sorted into sizes,
tied in bundles, dried in the sun, and stored in a
dry place until ready for peeling. When peeled
they should be dried for a day or so in the sun,
when if properly prepared they will be white and
brilliant; otherwise they will look dull, which
impairs their value in market. If exposed to
cold and dry winds, the growing osier should be
protected by wind-breaks. Dr. F. B. Hough,
Chief of the Forestry Division of the Department
of Agriculture, Washington, D. C., says: “An
osier plantation costs about $20 per acre for cultivation
and yields about $100 to $125 per acre.”
If this holds good anywhere in this country, it is
strange that osier cultivation is so generally reported
unprofitable.</p>

<p>Please give us instructions for plating or silvering
cups, spoons, and other metal articles.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A. H. Cox.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Electro-plating is a process that requires
apparatus, and a degree of skill in using
the same which render it scarcely worth while
to enter into a detailed description of it. We
outlined the process not long ago, and cannot
reiterate it. A cheap and simple method of silvering
metals, that any one can put in practice, is
as follows:</p>

<p>Clean the articles to be silvered with nitric acid,
rub them with a mixture of cyanide of potassium
and powdered silver, and wash thoroughly in clear,
warm water. Then plunge them into a liquor
composed of two parts, by weight, of grape sugar
or sugar of milk, two of gallic acid, and 650
parts of distilled water, filtered and kept from
the air in tightly-corked bottles until the instant
of use. After a few minutes take them out of
this liquor and immerse them in another composed
of twenty parts, by weight, of nitrate of
silver, twenty parts of ammonia solution, and
650 parts of distilled water. Repeat this process,
plunging the articles first into one liquor and
then into the other, every few minutes, until they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
are all well coated. The process can be accelerated
by heating either the mixture or the articles
to a moderate degree. Some persons prefer
to mix the two liquors at the moment of use in
equal quantities. In such case, shake the mixture
thoroughly and filter before immersing the
metals. The ammonia solution should be of
standard strength. If there is any doubt of this,
dissolve the nitrate of silver for the second
liquor in the distilled water, add the first liquor,
mix thoroughly, and add only enough ammonia
to clear the mixture. This is the process for copper,
brass, German silver, and similar articles,
but before silvering iron or steel they should be
coated with copper by leaving them for a little
time in a solution of sulphate of copper.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—For many years the invention of the

punishment adopted by the French during the
reign of terror, was accredited to Joseph Ignace
Guillotine, a French physician, born in 1738, who
in 1785 recommended its use in France from
motives of humanity, in place of the barbarous
gibbet. However, there is in the Antiquarian
Museum of Edinburgh a guillotine made before
1581, which served to behead the Scottish Regent,
Morton, who had introduced it into use in
that country. It was used in Italy in the thirteenth
century in a form resembling the instrument
now used in France. The guillotine is
composed of two upright beams, grooved upon
the inside, and surmounted by a cross-beam.
Between these beams and sliding in the grooves
is a sharp, iron blade, which falls by its own
weight with great speed and certainty, severing
the head from the body.</p>

<p>1. Explain the use of trade marks. 2. Who was
Bacchus?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">L. F. Hazelton.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—1. Trade marks secure a proprietary
right of a single firm in the article thus marked.
They are intended to prevent an unknown manufacturer
from palming off upon the public imitations
of goods that have acquired a reputation
from the original manufacturer; or they are a
certain warrant of the quality of articles bearing
them. 2. Bacchus, or Dionysius, was the Greek
god of wine, and, according to the myth, the son
of Zeus and Semele, the daughter of Cadmus of
Thebes. At his birth he was carried by Hermes
to Nysa, to be reared by the nymphs. Being
struck with madness, at the command of Juno,
he wandered from land to land, attended by
nymphs having their heads wreathed with vine
and ivy leaves and bearing in their hands the
thyrsus. To him is ascribed the knowledge of
the cultivation of the vine and the manufacture
of intoxicating wine, for in his wanderings he
carried to men of many lands this information.
Those who received him hospitably were rewarded,
but all who rejected him brought upon
themselves some form of misery. This hero and
demigod was worshiped throughout Greece, but
chiefly at Thebes, with sacrifices of goats and
oxen, and many noisy and indecent rites, until,
in 186 B. C., the Roman Senate suppressed the
mysteries, which were the principal feature of the
worship.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I should like to know in what year the Bishops of
the Church of Rome accepted the Apocrypha as a part
of the canon.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Laura A. Barslon.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—As early as the latter part of the first
century of the present era discussions arose
among Christians regarding the books rejected
by the Jews as profane, and at the Council of
Laodicea (360 A. D.) the Greek Church rejected
all books except those in the present Protestant
canon. In 474 Pope Gelasius convened a council
of seventy Bishops, which confirmed the
opinion of Pope Innocent I., recognizing the
Apocryphal books as sacred, and rejecting some
of the doubtful books of the New Testament.
The Council of Trent (1545-1563) finally settled
the mooted question for the Roman Catholic
Church, accepting the “Apocrypha” as a part of
the sacred canon. The Greek Church has much
the same books, while the Protestants retain only
the Hebrew canon of the Old Testament.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">John Short.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—After the union of church and state,
during the reign of Constantine the Great, as
the church attained great temporal power and
wealth, imposing rites and ceremonies were
added to her service, and, with these, abuses and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
corruption crept in. The first great evil was the
assumption by the church of spiritual dictatorship,
and to oppose it arose St. Ambrose, St.
Martin, and St. Stephen. Then occurred the
great reform within the church itself, inaugurated
by Pope Gregory III. for the purification of the
clergy; and at the same time came Abelard,
preaching liberty of thought in theology. But
the growth of new sects specially characterized
the four centuries immediately preceding the
Lutheran Reformation. Of these the principal
ones were the Lollards (1324), the Hussites
(1373), the Moravian Brethren (1417), and the
Mystics (1340-1471). 2. The supreme authority
of the Pope in all religious matters has been
generally acknowledged in the Roman Catholic
Church from very early times, but the infallibility
of the Pope, in regard to faith and morals,
was not formulated and decreed by the Vatican
Council until July 18, 1870.</p>

<p class="right">

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There are several articles on the tariff
in Our Curiosity Shop for 1880, to which we must
refer you; particularly one on page 149, entitled
“The Tariff and the Farmers.” According to high
statistical authority the commerce and principal

and Germany in 1880 compared as follows:</p>

<p>The commerce above referred to is mainly foreign
commerce. In the case of Great Britain,
what corresponds to our inter-State commerce
(the trade between the different portions of the
one extended government) is included under the
head of “Commerce,” swelling the aggregate
largely, whereas but a small portion of the interstate
commerce of the United States is included
in the above estimate of our “Commerce.” Our
fifty million people buy and sell among themselves
to supply each other’s wants, and consume
a much larger proportion of their domestic products
per capita for their own comfort than do the
English, French, or Germans. The effects of the
tariff in building up American manufactures are

<p>Comparatively few of our manufactures are exported,
because our agriculture, mining, manufacturing,
commercial, and professional classes
consume them at home. So, too, the products of
our mines are mostly kept at home, and four-fifths
of our agricultural products. If our foreign
carrying trade is not so large as Great Britain’s,
our coasting and other domestic carrying trade
exceeds hers. By division of labor we are creating
a world of our own, setting up our own standards
of wages, and modes of living, and are, as a consequence,
living better, enjoying more of the
comforts of life, man for man, than any other

<p>I come to you for a little light. In Abbott’s “Life of
Cleopatra” the author states that in early times the
Bible was not kept by the Jews as any other than a
vulgar history. I should like to know whether there
is any authority for the assertion.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Laura A. Barslow.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—For hundreds of years before the
birth of Christ the books of Moses and other
works sanctioned by the prophets (whose duty it
was to guard the people against spurious writings
or the loss of what was genuine) were regarded
by the Jews as so sacred that “no one dared to
add to or omit or alter anything;” so Josephus
tells us. An authentic copy was kept in the Temple,
while others copied from it were circulated
for use in the synagogues of different places. A
Jewish tradition ascribes to Ezra, after the return
of the Jews from the captivity, and the college
of learned men called the “Great Synagogue,”
the collection and selection of writings
which form the Jewish and the present Protestant
Old Testament canon. There is no good authority
for the statement in your question.</p>

<p>To settle a dispute, state whether the sun stays north
of the equator longer than it does south of it; and if
so, why.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Young Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The earth’s orbit is not a perfect
circle, but an ellipse with the sun in one of the
foci, at a point on the long diameter of the orbit
something more than a million miles from the
center in the direction of perigee, or the place
where the earth approaches nearest to the sun.
In 1882 the sun was in perigee Dec. 31, and in
apogee—the point furthest from the earth—on
July 3. For several thousand years to come the
perigee point will be south of the equator, as it
has been for several thousand years past. As a
consequence of this and because the earth
moves more rapidly the nearer it gets
to the sun, it takes it less time to travel
through that part of its orbit south of the
equator than through the portion north of it. In
the year 1800 the sun was north of the equator
seven days 16 hours and 51 minutes longer than
it was south of it. The sun crossed the equator,
coming north, March 21, 1882, at 12:02 o’clock
at night, and crossed it on the return Sept. 22,
1882, at 10:29 o’clock p. m., an interval of 185
days 10 hours and 27 minutes. It reached the
equator next on its return northward, March 20,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
1883, at 5:39 o’clock p. m., an interval of 177
days 19 hours and 10 minutes. So that the
northern hemisphere had a longer spring and
summer than the southern hemisphere last year
by seven days 15 hours and 27 seconds. The
Brazilians and Terra del Fuegans may console
themselves with the reflection that in about 6,000
years they will get even with us, and that in a
little more than 12,000 years from now the sun
will linger in the southern hemisphere a full week
longer than in the northern.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Ed. S. Jelley.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—September 24, 1869, Jay Gould and
James Fisk, Jr., attempted to create a corner in
the gold market by buying all the gold in the
banks of New York City, amounting to $15,000,000.
For several days the value of gold rose
steadily, and the speculators aimed to carry it
from 144 to 200. Friday the whole city was in a
ferment, the banks were rapidly selling, gold was
at 162½ and still rising. Men became insane and
everywhere the wildest excitement raged, for it
seemed probable that the business houses must
be closed, from ignorance of the prices to be
charged for their goods. But in the midst of the
panic it was reported that Secretary Boutwell, of
the United States Treasury, had thrown $4,000,000
on the market, and at once gold fell, the excitement
ceased, leaving Gould and Fisk the
winners of $11,000,000. There is no good evidence
that President Grant had any connection
with the sales. The fact that his
brother-in-law was interested in Wall street
operations at that time led to the
charge against Grant by his enemies.
The day noticed above is what is generally referred
to as Black Friday in this country, but the
term was first used in England, being applied in
the first instance to the Friday on which the
news reached London that the young Pretender,
Charles Edward, had arrived at Derby, creating a
terrible panic: and finally to May 11, 1866, when
the failure of Overend, Guerney &amp; Co., London,
the day before, was followed by a widespread

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">G. H. Snedaker.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The homestead law contemplates immediate
settlement by the claimant upon the
land; and section 2,297 of the Revised Statutes
declares that if at any time after he has filed his
entry affidavit it is shown, to the satisfaction of
the receiver of the land office, that the claimant
has actually changed his residence, “or abandoned
the land for more than six months,” at any time,
the land shall revert to the government. “Copps’
American Settlers’ Guide,” page 53, says:
“At the expiration of six months from
date of entry the homestead party who
has not been able to establish a
bona fide residence upon the homestead, owing to
climatic reasons, must file his affidavit, duly corroborated
by two credible witnesses, giving in
detail the storms, etc., that rendered it impossible
for him to commence residence within six

with the law, making it unnecessary to appeal
to the decree of the General Land Commissioner,
a very uncertain resort in cases of
this nature.</p>

<p>In Peoria, Quincy, Rock Island, Galena, Alton,
Cairo, Belleville, Springfield, LaSalle, Ottawa,
Morris, Kankakee, and low-license towns generally,
the number of saloons as compared with
population is still greater, averaging but little
better than Chicago with its license of only $103,
and one saloon to every 160 inhabitants—men,
women, and children. Fifty-eight high-license
towns of the State, with a population of 189,000,
contain 401 saloons, or one to every 470 inhabitants.
Make all the allowance that can be
reasonably asked for the moderate drinking of
the farming classes, and discount, if possible, our
estimate for Chicago, and the total cost of liquor
drank in Illinois exceeds $60 000 000 per annum.

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Shenandoah</span>, Iowa.<br>
</p>

<p>When, how and by whom were diamonds first discovered?
What is the etymology of the word
diamond? How did their value when first discovered
compare with the same now? What is the value of a
one-carat diamond of the finest quality?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">R. P. Drake.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The discoverer of diamonds is unknown.
From references in Exodus it is apparent
that the diamond was a precious stone in
Egypt in those early times; and even
before that it was known in India, where probably
it was first obtained. The name is derived
from the Greek word <em>adamas</em>, meaning “unsubduable,”
referring to its hardness, and later was
written <em>diamas</em>, in Latin. From Pliny, a writer
of the first century, we learn that the diamond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
was regarded as the most valuable of all things,
and but few kings even could afford to buy them.
But as no means of artificial polishing had been
discovered the stone depreciated in value, so
that the ruby and emerald became more precious.
The discovery by Ludwig van Berquen, in 1476,
of a mode of cutting and polishing it, at once
returned this gem to the first place among precious
stones. The present value of a fine brilliant,
weighing one carat, varies from $50 to
$100. The rose and table diamonds command
much less. Larger diamonds appreciate in value
much more rapidly than the ratio of their weight.
The Orloff diamond, 193 carats, is valued at
$500,000; the Pitt diamond, 136 carats, at
$600,000; the Dudley diamond, 254½ carats, at
$750,000; while the Kohinoor, for various
reasons, although now it weighs but 102½
carats, is estimated to be worth $2,000,000.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The true name of this celebrated
dwarf was Charles Heywood Stratton. He was
born in Bridgeport, Conn., Jan. 4, 1838, and died
at his residence, Middleboro, Mass., July 15,
1883, of apoplexy. The attention of P. T. Barnum,
the showman, was first drawn to Stratton
in November, 1842, when the midget was about
4 years old. He was then less than 2 feet high,
weighed less than 16 pounds, was beautifully
formed, a blonde, with ruddy cheeks and mirthful
eyes. Barnum introduced him to the public
Dec. 8, 1842, by the name of General Tom Thumb;
now known the world over. He paid him $3 a week
and expenses for himself and his mother for the
first four weeks, after which he engaged him for a
year at $7 a week, but, as the boy proved a great
attraction, he soon raised the wages to $25 a
week. In January, 1846, under a contract of
$50 a week, Mr. Barnum took him to Europe,
where he made a profitable tour through England,
France, and Germany. He was presented to
Queen Victoria, Louis Phillipe, King William of
Prussia (now the German Emperor), and other
rulers, who treated him with marked kindness.
The next year he returned to Europe for three
months. On his return home he proved a
greater attraction than ever, and Mr. Barnum
says that in twelve days in Philadelphia he received
$5,504.91; and in one day at Providence
he took in $976.98. In 1857 he took Tom Thumb
and Cordelia Howard, famous as little Eva in
“Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” to Europe, where these
children appeared in humorous characters, creating
a furore and gathering a golden harvest. In
1862 Mr. Barnum introduced the two sister midgets,
Lavinia and Minnie Warren, to the public,
the former of whom young Stratton married before
the end of that year. True to his chief instinct
Barnum desired to turn the courting and
the marriage ceremony to pecuniary account,
offering $15,000 to postpone the wedding for a
month, and then have it take place in the Academy
of Music as an exhibition at so much a seat.
To the credit of the bride and groom, they repelled
this offer with just indignation, and were
married in Grace Church, New York. The public
reception at the Metropolitan Hotel, immediately
following, was a notable affair. After this, for
week after week, the three tiny folks drew crowds
of admirers at Barnum’s old museum on the corner
where the New York <cite>Herald</cite> office now
stands, the receipts sometimes being over $3,000
a day. Mr. and Mrs. Stratton had a pleasant
home at Middleboro, where they spent a large
part of their time when not on the stage. They
had one child, who died at the age of 2 years and
6 months. Both of them have been noted for
sprightly intelligence, and have hosts of friends
in all circles of society.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—He was born at Ajaccio, Corsica,
Aug. 15, 1769. His mother, a strong and cultured,
but severe woman, ruled her household
with a rod of iron, and to her the son owed his
indomitable will. At ten years of age he was sent
to a military school at Brienne, France, and six
years later entered the army. In 1792, having
taken an active part in the defection in Ajaccio,
he was expelled, with the rest of his family, from
the city. After several years of brilliant military
service Napoleon was made commander of the
campaign in Italy, which closed with the treaty
of Campo Formio. On the eve of his departure he
was married to the beautiful and accomplished
Mme. Josephine Beauharnais. The year after
the close of the Italian campaign (1797) Napoleon
set out for Egypt, designing to investigate its
wealth, art treasures and other antiquities, but
the expedition proved disastrous and he
soon returned to meet a critical state
of affairs in France, leaving the army under
the command of General Kleber. On Aug. 2,
1802, the French people made Bonaparte First
Consul for life, and in the same year received at
his hands the famous Code Napoleon, the product
of the best legal talent of the nation, and undoubtedly
one of the noblest monuments of his
administration. It still forms the great body of
French law. Two years later, he was proclaimed
Emperor. After a remarkable career in war and
peace, he sacrificed his heart and highest manhood
to his ambition by divorcing his faithful Josephine
to form a royal alliance with Maria Louisa,
daughter of the Emperor of Austria. The decline
of his power soon followed, like a pursuing Nemesis;
beginning with the fearful disasters succeeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
the burning of Moscow and the ensuing retreat
in the midst of a Russian winter, and ending
with the disastrous battle of Leipsic, the fall
of Paris, his first abdication, and his exile (1814)
to the little island of Elba. He escaped to France
ten months later; raised another army, and
hastened to meet the allies—English, Germans,
and Netherlanders—in Belgium,
on the fatal field of Waterloo.
A few months later and he was a prisoner for life
on the desolate island of St. Helena, in custody
of Great Britain, where he died of cancer of the
stomach May 5, 1821. By almost universal concession
he is regarded as the greatest military
commander that ever lived. Had his diplomacy
been equal to his military genius it is probable
that he would have remained to his death, as he
was for a period of more than six years, the virtual
master of nearly all the civilized States of
Continental Europe. In 1840 his mortal remains
were carried to France and buried in Paris, the
scene of his greatest triumphs as of his final
downfall.</p>

<p>Who was called the “Apostle of Hungary,” where
was he born, and when did he live?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">W. I. Pratt.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—St. Anastasius, surnamed Astric, was
born in France, A. D. 954, and died in 1044. He
gained great influence over Stephen I., King of
Hungary, 997-1038, who intrusted the zealous
missionary with almost unlimited powers. These
he used with such rare wisdom and spirit that
the Hungarians were rapidly converted from
paganism. The freedom of all Christian slaves
was proclaimed, the political organization of the
kingdom was reconstructed, schools were established,
and, in fine, Hungary was transformed
from barbarism to a state of inchoate Christian
civilization. He is honored in history and tradition
as the “Apostle of Hungary.”</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The civil or tropical year, the one
commonly used in the measure of time, is the
period which elapses from the sun’s appearance
on one of the tropical circles to its return to the
same. It varies very slightly, and has a mean
length of 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 49.7
seconds. Astronomically considered, the four
seasons begin at the equinoctial or the solstitial
points. The summer solstice is the meridian,
passing through the point where the sun touches
the tropic of cancer; the winter solstice is the
meridian passing through the point where
it touches the tropic of capricorn;
and the equinoctial points are the points at
which the sun’s path or equinoctial crosses the
celestial equator. All these points shift, according
to very exact astronomical laws, from year to
year; and so the precise times when the seasons
begin are matters of the nicest mathematical
calculations. For example, last year the seasons
began as follows:</p>

<p>Winter began Dec. 21, 1881, at 10:52 a. m. and
lasted 90 days, 1 hour, and 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Spring began March 21, 1882, at 12:02 p. m.
and lasted 91d, 20h, and 4m.</p>

<p>Summer began June 21, 1882, at 8:06 a. m. and
lasted 93d, 14h, and 23m.</p>

<p>Winter began Dec. 21, 1882, at 4:45 p. m. and
lasted 89d, 18h, and 16m.</p>

<p>The beginning of the seasons this year are
given as follows:</p>

<p>Winter began Dec. 21, 1882, at 4:45 p. m. and
lasted 88 days, and 54 minutes.</p>

<p>Spring began March 20, 1883, at 5:39 p. m. and

</p>

<p>Please give me an account of Henry Clay and his
descendants.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Henry Clay was born near Richmond,
Va., April 12, 1777. His father died in
1782, and ten years later his mother married
again and moved to Kentucky, leaving Henry as
a clerk in Richmond. In 1797 Henry followed
her, and opened a law office in Lexington. He
took an active part in the framing of a new constitution
for Kentucky, upon her separation from
Virginia when he strongly urged some provision
for the abolition of slavery, but in vain. From
this time he became prominent in politics. In
1803 a State Senator, a United States Senator in
1806, one of the negotiators of peace in the war
of 1812, and twice a Speaker of the House, he
was no stranger to statesmanship when in 1824
he appeared as a candidate for the presidency.
He was defeated, however, as was also the case in
1832 and 1844 when he was the candidate of
the Whig party. As an orator he stands among
the very first that this country has produced. As
a statesman he was far-seeing, a wise political
economist, a devoted lover of the Union, and absolutely
incorruptible. “I would rather be right than
be the President,” is one of his utterances, made
under circumstances that tested his sincerity.
He did what he believed was right, offended the
slave oligarchy thereby, as he foresaw he should
do, and barely failed of election to the presidency
in the ensuing campaign as the consequence.
Knowing the desperate measures to which the
champions of slavery would resort to preserve
and extend that institution, he averted threatened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
secession in 1821 by bringing forward the
“Missouri Compromise;” again in 1850 by another
compromise known as the “Omnibus bill.”
The effect of these pacific measures was to defer
the inevitable final appeal to arms until the
strength of the free States had outgrown the
slave power, and the Union was able to grapple
with secession and throttle it. As one of the
commissioners who negotiated the treaty of
Ghent, at the close of the second war with England,
he caused the erasure of the clause
granting free navigation of the Mississippi
to British vessels. Protection to American industry
through a wise adjustment of the tariff, found
in him one of the ablest of its early champions.
Mr. Clay married Lucretia Hart, in 1799, who
bore him six daughters and five sons. The last
of the daughters died in 1835. Of the sons, the
most promising, Henry, born in 1811, fell at the
battle of Buena Vesta, Feb. 23, 1847. James B.,
born in 1817, was a representative in Congress
from his father’s old district, 1857-9. He was a
member of the Peace Commission of 1861; died
at Montreal, Jan. 26, 1864. Thomas Hart, born
in 1803, took office under President Lincoln as
minister to Nicaragua, and, later, to Honduras.
He died at Lexington, Ky., March 18, 1871.</p>

of most of the old workers and drones. As

young queens lead forth other swarms, composed
for the most part of young bees, until
only one queen remains in the old hive with a

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Nettie Ayres.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Martin Luther was born of poor
parents, at Eisleben, in 1483. After studying at
Erfurt and being confirmed priest, Luther accepted
a professorship at the University of Wittemberg
in 1508. In 1510 he was sent on a mission
to Rome, where he had an insight into the
corruptions of the papacy, and upon his return
he immediately entered upon his work of reform,
especially attacking the sale of indulgences. One
of his first acts was to nail on the door of Wittemberg
Church ninety-five theses, in which he denied
the power of the Pope to forgive sins.
Great excitement followed, and Luther was summoned
by Pope Leo X. to appear at Rome. The
university and electors interfered, and a legate
from Rome came to Germany to hear Luther’s
defense. Soon Luther’s books and papers gained
a wide circulation, and in 1520 came a papal
bull of excommunication, which Luther burned
in the gate of Wittemberg in the presence of a
large company. The next year Charles V. convened
the Diet of Worms, which ordered the destruction
of Luther’s books and the arrest of the
heretic. He was now imprisoned by friends in
the Castle of Wartburg for his protection, and
soon after his release married the gifted Katharine
Von Bora, a nun whom he had converted to
Protestantism. His later life was spent in writing
and controversy, though, on the whole, very
quiet. He died in 1546.</p>

River and its tributaries.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">J. H. Rhodes.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—1. Rock Island is about 536 feet, St.
Louis 408 feet, and Cairo about 322 feet above
tide-water. 2. The number of inches fall per
mile required to give a current of two miles depends
very greatly upon the volume of the
stream, the character of the bed, and the directness
of the channel. The same stream is sluggish
at low water and a rushing torrent at high flood.
The current of the Lower Mississippi, with a fall
of nearly three inches per mile, has an annual
average of three miles an hour in midstream. 3.
The slope of rivers falling into the Mississippi
from the west is about six inches per mile, and
that of those from the east is about three inches
per mile, except in the case of the Ohio River,
whose mean descent from Pittsburg to Cairo, including
the falls and rapids at Louisville, is about
5⅙ inches. The mean descent of the Mississippi
from the mouth of the Ohio to the gulf is
a little over 2⅘ inches a mile. Between Lake
Itasca and the mouth of the Ohio the
descent of the Mississippi is much more rapid.
From its source to the Falls of Pecogama, 270
miles, the total descent is 324 feet; thence to
Pine River, 200 miles, the fall is 165 feet; thence
to Crow Wing, 47 miles, it is 49 feet. Below this
are the Sauk Rapids, then the Rapids and Falls
of St. Anthony, 18 feet at a leap and 66 feet in a
single mile; then the Rock Island Rapids, 22 feet;
and the Des Moines Rapids, 24 feet. The total
descent between Lake Itasca and the mouth of
the Ohio is 1,285 feet.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Eighteen years ago, when General
Booth began his work in London as a Methodist
minister to the artisan classes, he was confronted
by the great question, how to bring the gospel to
the hearts of the ignorant and degraded so as to
make it a vital power. After many trials and
failures he began the organization of what is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
known as the Salvation Army numbering at
present 320 corps, with 760 officers who give
their entire time to the work, having over all a
“general.” Their creed is the literal gospel, and
it is preached by them in no less than 6,200 meetings
a week. Their territory is divided into thirteen
districts, each under the care of a “major,”
who inspects and controls all the corps in his district.
To each corps is assigned a “captain,”
assisted by one or two “lieutenants,” who devote
all their time to conducting meetings, visiting
those enlisted, and organizing work among the
unconverted. The system of promotion is slow
and guarded. When a person professes a change
of heart he must at once rise and confess it before
his former associates. He is then placed under
the supervision of the sergeant of the district
in which he resides, whose duty it is to report
him to the captain if he fails in the proper performance
of any religious duty. He must always
wear the letter S in some conspicuous place, and
is soon given the charge of a part or the whole of
a street. If faithful in these duties, godly in
character, and of good general ability, he may be
recommended by his captain for promotion. The
major refers him to the general, and if he answers
satisfactorily a long list of questions asked him
by the latter he is sent to the “training barracks”
at Clapton, whence, after from six weeks to three
months, he is dispatched to some distant field as
lieutenant. Each officer is expected to lead from
nineteen to twenty-five meetings a week, and
spend eighteen hours in visiting families. The
army has become so large that the management of
affairs devolves upon the majors. Its property is
held by an attorney in the name of the general.
All who are able must contribute toward the general
expenses, and most of the corps are now self-supporting.
The salaries are met by general subscription.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—He is first cousin to Queen Victoria;
being the son of Adolphus Frederick, Duke of
Cambridge, tenth child of George III., of whom
Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, the Queen’s
father, was fifth child. He succeeded to the title of
his father, July 8, 1850. In 1837 he was promoted
to a colonelcy in the British army. In
1854 he was Lieutenant General commanding
the first division sent to aid Turkey against Russia
in what is known as the Crimean war. He led
the troops at Alma and Inkerman. There was a
good deal of dissatisfaction expressed at the slow
progress of the war, and under the plea of ill-health
he returned to England, where, in 1856,
he succeeded Viscount Hardinge as Commander-in-chief.
In 1862 he was raised to the rank of
Field Marshal. He has never married, but—like
his Uncle William IV., who lived for many years
with Mrs. Jordan, the actress, rearing a numerous
illegitimate family by her, and his Uncle Augustus
Frederick, Duke of Sussex, who, in violation
of the royal marriage act, married a subject, the
Lady Augusta Murray, who bore him two illegitimate
children—he has persistently lived for many
years with Miss Fairbrother, once known as a
beautiful actress, by whom he has several illegitimate
children, well provided for out of his large
income.</p>

<p>Please give a synopsis of the observations and opinions

antiquity of man upon the earth.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">R. Ashley.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—To summarize the earliest recorded
geological evidences of man’s life as briefly as
possible it may be said: 1. In the
words of Professor Archibald Geikie, of Edinburgh
University, “The geological deposits which
contain the history of the human period are
cavern loam, river alluvia, lake bottoms, peat
mosses, and other superficial accumulations.”
Human remains are not found imbedded in
stratified rock, as in the cases of
the fossilized plants and animals of
the lower orders. The entire period
in which any supposed evidences of the existence
of man have been discovered is the Miocene or
middle epoch of the Tertiary period. They consist
of a few flint flakes, fancied to have been
used, possibly, as human implements, but so
roughly shaped that it is admitted they may be
simply natural; and some bones of animals,
scratched as if scraped by men, but more probably
by the teeth of wild animals. No geologist
of high repute acknowledges any of these crude
objects and marks as proof of the existence of
man in the Miocene period. It has been claimed
that traces of man were found in California, in
Calaveras County, and on Table Mountain, in the
next later formation, the Pliocene. But M.
Favre, reviewing the whole subject up to 1870,
and Mr. Evans, President of the Geological Society
of London, still later, in 1875, declare that
the existence of man in any epoch of the Tertiary
period is unproved. 2. The next period is the
Quaternary, which immediately precedes the
geological epoch in which we are living,
known as the “recent epoch.” The Quaternary
period is subdivided into three epochs, of
which the earliest was the “glacial,” the second
the “champlain,” and the third the “terrace.”
During the first of these the northern regions of
Europe, Asia, and America appear to have been
capped with ice down to about the latitude of 40
degrees north. During the second the glaciers
melted, the ice cap receded toward the pole, and
the greater part of the now cultivable regions of
the northern hemisphere were flooded with seas
and lakes, underneath which heavy sedimentary
deposits were found. During the third epoch
land continued to rise; the lakes were drained
off; mighty rivers took the place of many of the
lakes, cutting deep channels through the old
flood plain-deposits left by glaciers and lakes,
and leaving terraces or bluffs, such as are seen
along the Mississippi, Missouri, and other great
rivers. In this formation, in the terraces
of the river Somme, near Abbeville, M.
Boucher de Perthes discovered, about 1858,
chipped flints, associated with the bones of the
mammoth, rhinoceros, hyena, horse, etc., which
are generally regarded as human implements.
Similar discoveries were made at Hoxne, England,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
in strata underlying the higher level river-gravels,
but overlying the glacier deposit, which
seems to fix this discovery in the champlain
epoch. A well-shaped human skull was found in
a cave at Engis, near Liege, Belgium, associated
with bones of extinct and living species, beneath
a crust of stalagmite, which are believed to belong
to the middle or latter part of the Quaternary
period. Near Nice, in a cave at Mentone, a few
years ago, was found the skeleton of a man, associated
with the bones of the cave-bear and the
cave-lion—long extinct in that region—and the
bones of living species, such as the reindeer and
stag, with twenty-two perforated teeth of the
stag lying around his head as if they had been
worn as a necklace. In what is called the
Aurignac cave in France were found seventeen
human skeletons of both sexes and all
sizes, along with entire bones of extinct animals,
and human implements and ornaments.
The cave was closed up with a slab, and outside
of it was a deposit of ashes and cinders, with burnt
and split and knawed bones of extinct animals,
covered with talus, or a sloping heap of broken
rock and earth. Coming down from these discoveries
to those of apparently later times, the habitations
of more civilized men have been discovered
in what are called the “lake dwellings” of
Switzerland, of New Guinea, South America, and
in some parts of Africa. Such are the chief indications
of the antiquity of man, reckoned by geological
periods and epochs; but how to reduce
these latter to years is still an unsolved problem;
so much so that some geologists claim that the
beginning of the terrace epoch, which, as above
shown, contains the earliest well-defined human
remains, does not extend back more than 7,000
to 10,000 years, while others date it back from
50,000 to 60,000 years. Professor Le Conte sums
up his review of this question by saying: “In

<p>Please give a description of the Palace of the Cæsars
and the “Golden House” of Nero. How far were they
apart, and how much did they cost?</p>

<p class="right">
J. J. R.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Palace of the Cæsars, if we judge
from the Latin authors, was of all palaces of its
time the most magnificent. The palace of Augustus,
built upon the site of the houses of Cicero
and Catiline, was its beginning, and each succeeding
Emperor altered and improved it. Tiberius
and Caligula enlarged it, Nero added his
Golden House, and Titus used the portion on the
Esquiline Hill for his famous baths. It is now a
mass of shapeless ruins, extending over three
hills of Rome, and covering an area 1,500 feet in
length and 1,300 feet in width, giving no hint of
what it once was in architecture or embellishment.
All is left to the imagination of the poet
except the beauty of the Golden House, which
soon outrivaled the splendor of the older palace
of which it was a part. It is said to have been
the houses of Augustus and Maecenas connected
by arches and columns, and it extended over the
Palatine, Esquiline, and Cælian Hills of Rome.
The interior was covered with gold and precious
stones, and adorned with the finest paintings and
statuary that the world afforded. The circular
banquet hall, perpetually revolving in imitation
of the apparent motion of the sun about the earth,
had vaulted iron ceilings, which, opening, scattered
flowers upon the guests, and golden pipes
through which ran sweet perfumes. In the vestibule
stood Nero’s statue, 120 feet in height. The
palace was surrounded by a triple portico a mile
in length, and supported by a thousand columns,
and within this lay an immense lake, whose
banks were bordered by great buildings, each
representing a little city, about which lay green
pastures and groves, where sported “all animals,
both tame and wild.” It is impossible to learn
how much these palaces cost. They were not far
apart, but reference to Tacitus Annals shows
that they were distinct structures.</p>

<p>To settle a dispute, state whether Nebraska voted

Springfield, Ill., and then took it back, or refused to
pay it over to the Monument Association.</p>

<p class="right">
A. C. F.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—By an act approved Feb. 15, 1869,
the Legislature of Nebraska appropriated $500
“to aid in the construction of the National Lincoln
Monument at or near Springfield, Ill.” In
September, 1882, when visiting the monument,
the Hon. Isham Reavis, of Falls City, Neb., who
voted for this appropriation, learned incidentally
from Mr. J. C. Power, the custodian, that the Association
had never received the money. On his
return to Nebraska he went to Lincoln, and by
examination of the Auditor’s books found that
the $500 had never been remitted, and that in
due time it had by operation of law been covered
back into the treasury with other unexpended
balances. With the hearty co-operation
of the Hon. C. H. Gere, of the
<cite>Nebraska State Journal</cite>, who as a member of the
Senate had participated in the act of appropriation,
Judge Reavis induced leading members of
the last Legislature to revive the appropriation.
The Legislature of New York had set an example
some time before by the reappropriation of the
$10,000 which it had voted to the monument, but
which had been permitted to lapse before it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
been called for. Having been informed that the
monument was then about complete, that the association
was not in debt, and that the receipts
from visitors for admission to the monument
pay all current expenses, but that if
the Nebraska appropriation was paid
over it would be used in embellishing
the nine acres of ground surrounding the
monument, the Legislature, on or about Feb. 23,
1883, reappropriated the original amount of $500.
After all, therefore, Nebraska has a share in this
splendid memorial to the immortal Lincoln.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="smcap">Emporia</span>, Kan.<br>
</p>

<p>Your reply to J. R. Thompson has awakened
in my mind a desire to know more about the
Japanese currency and financial conditions. What
led to the issue of the Japanese “fiat money,” as you
call it? Was this paper money “convertible?” What
was it based on? When was it redeemable, and how?
What was the financial standing of the government at
the time, and what is it now?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">E. D. Humphrey.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The treaties made with Japan by foreign
nations when that country was wholly unsophisticated
in treaty-making and inexperienced
in the laws of international commerce, provided
for the admission of foreign products on what is
practically a free-trade basis. As a consequence,
the balance of trade has for years past been
against Japan, her exports being considerably
less in value than her imports. For example, in
1880 the exports from Japan to Great Britain
(which country gets two-thirds of the whole
Japanese foreign trade) amounted to only £531,621,
while the British “home produce” alone imported
into Japan amounted to £3,290,906.
Again and again Japan, seeing the ruinous effects
on home industry resulting from the
too moderate tariff fixed by the foreign
treaties, has sought to get a modification of
those treaties permitting her to increase the tariff,
but thus far with little effect. Of course the
difference between the value of the imports and
exports has to be paid in the precious metals.
The country was already suffering from this drain
of bullion, when a civil war broke out in 1868,
and the government was forced to issue paper
currency to meet its ordinary and extraordinary
expenses. This first issue bore a promise of redemption
at the end of thirteen years; but, though
the rebellion had been put down and a peaceful
and, in many respects, a strong, progressive government
had been established, this government
was not in a condition to keep its promises, and
the old currency issue was replaced with a new
one, without any stipulation as to when it should
be redeemed. The people looked upon it with
distrust, and, although it was a legal tender, it
was not long before it dropped to 50
cents on the dollar as compared with
specie. The government took warning,
entered upon a contraction of expenditures,
strove to inspire confidence in the currency, and
by contracting the volume somewhat, it has
raised the value of its paper money to about 75
cents on the dollar.</p>

<p>When Japan opened its ports to foreign commerce
it was substantially without debt. It is
not even now heavily burdened, and could it
once check the influx of foreign goods and so develop
its home productions as to bring exports
and imports to something like an equilibrium, its
financial condition would be superior to that of
most other countries. Its foreign debt in January,
1875, amounted to no more than £3,400,000,
which had been reduced by the action of the
sinking fund to £2,134,700 at the end of 1881;
and its home debt in July, 1880, stood at £69,406,919—a
total of about $357,700,000; of
which $108,000,000 was the “fiat money,” or
irredeemable paper currency above described.</p>

<p>What do the abbreviations <em>a</em> and <em>ap</em> before a surname

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Sea.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—These particles, “a” and “ap,” are
abbreviations of Latin prepositions meaning
“of” and “at” or “from.” Generally, when connected
with names, they refer to the town or
place where one was born, or the family estate.
In the case, for example, of Thomas <em>a</em> Kempis,
author of that famous work entitled “Imitation
of Christ,” which has been translated into more
languages than any other book, save the Bible,
the “a” denotes “from.” His family name was
Thomas Hammerken. He was born in 1379 or
1380 in the town of Kempen, near Cologne. He
was educated first at Deventer, then at Zwolle,
and in the Convent of St. Agnes. After the custom
of the times at these schools, he was known
as “Thomas from Kempen,” and, finally, as happened
in many other such cases, the school name
pushed aside the family name.</p>

In the spring, when the sap rises, peel
them by drawing through a crotched stake set

iron. If the willow is allowed to dry before peeling
it will be hard to get the bark off and the

Richter. How is Richter pronounced?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Jean Paul Friedrick Richter was one
of the most original characters in the literary
world. He was a man of much general information,
but of erratic genius. It has been said that
he wrote in “gems,” so filled are his works with
beautiful ideas. But his style is too careless and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
his thoughts too rambling to place him among
classical writers. He was born at Wunsiedel, in
Bavaria, March 21, 1763. Though, when quite
young, his father’s death left the family in poverty,
Jean Paul resolved to go to Leipsic, and by
the greatest self-sacrifice he accomplished his resolve.
At the end of four years, however, he was
obliged to leave the town secretly to escape being
arrested for debt. He now abandoned the idea
of entering the church and taught for a few
years, writing meanwhile. When, in 1794, he
began his visits to German literary centers, he
found himself the idol of the ladies, who treasured
even the shorn locks of his poodle, and
sometimes ventured to propose to the eccentric
author himself. But he rejected them all, and in
1801 chose for himself the brilliant Caroline
Mayer, of Berlin. Ever afterward the King of
Bavaria gave him an annual pension of 1,000
florins and he received the degree of doctor from
the University of Heidelberg. In his later years
his mental strength failed and in 1824 he became
totally blind. He died at Bayreuth Nov. 14, 1825,
surrounded by loving friends. His character,
though eccentric, was beautiful in its gentleness
and philanthropy. The poor were his chief
mourners. Carlyle has translated some of his
writings and found in him a theme for two of his
best essays. The ch in Richter’s name has the
same sound as in the German word for book. It
can be learned properly only by oral instruction.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Properly speaking, the “Guinea pig”
(cava caboya) is not a pig, but a rodent closely related
to the restless cavy of Uraguay and Brazil,
belonging to the same natural order as the rat
and beaver. Like the cavidae, it burrows in the
ground, and feeds upon fruits and herbs. Its
chief value consists in its beauty, which may be
described thus: A white fur, patched with red
and black, covering a little animal a foot long and
weighing from a pound to a pound and a half—a
creature inoffensive and helpless in the extreme,
exceedingly restless, and not remarkably intelligent.
It is supposed that this cavy was carried
from South America to Europe in the fifteenth or
sixteenth century, and there domesticated; and
that its name is a corruption of Guiana pig. It is
very prolific, beginning to breed at the age of two
months, and rearing a brood of four to twelve
three times a year.</p>

into the Moldavian desert, between the Danube and
the Niester, the King of the Scythians sent him a
mouse, a frog, a bird, and five arrows; a tremendous
allegory!” What did this allegory signify?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">C. P. Dutton.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It has been variously interpreted.
The following is the meaning given it by some
writers: “You make war (the arrows) on a people
you cannot conquer until you can subsist on
roots and wild grain like the mouse, inhabit
either land or water, like the frog, and flee with
the swiftness of a bird.” Another rendering is:
“We subsist in the wild fields like the mouse;
live either on land or water, like the frog; flee
like the bird, and slay our pursuers as we flee, for
our right hands are full of arrows for our enemies.”
Darius Hystaspes had demanded an offering
of earth and water from them as a token of
submission, and this was the answer of these invincible
barbarians; and they made good their
allegory. As Darius pursued them with an army
of 700,000 men they led him farther and farther,
through forests, swamps, and deserts, until his
troops died of fatigue, malaria, and famine, and
he was compelled to return, utterly defeated in
his object, leaving all but a mere remnant of his
immense army dead in the wilderness.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="smcap">Yellowstone</span>, Wis.<br>
</p>

<p>The “New American Dictionary” says that the Missouri
is the longest river in the world, 4,194 miles, and
that the Mississippi is 3,200. “Wilson’s Geography”
says the Mississippi is 4,396, and the Missouri is 3,960
miles long. Please tell us which is right, and the
reasons for these variations.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">James Lyons.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The fact is that the precise lengths of
the chief rivers of the globe are not known. They
shift their channels and wind to such a degree as
renders it a difficult problem to determine the exact
length of any one of them, and exactness in
such cases is not as yet a matter of sufficient
practical importance to justify the expense of
making accurate measurements. If it were, it
would be found that every great river varies in
length from time to time by cutting new channels
for itself. As a consequence all statements are
only estimates, and scarcely two original writers
precisely agree. The latest edition of “Lippincott’s
Gazetteer of the World” does not presume to
speak positively, but says: “The Mississippi is
about 3,000 miles long (or, as some say, 3,160).”
Speaking of the Missouri, it says: “The total
length of the stream, from its source to the Gulf of
Mexico, is computed to be 4,300 miles.” “Chambers’
Universal Knowledge” says the Mississippi
River is 2,986 miles long from its source to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
mouth, and that from the latter to the source of
the Missouri is 4,506 miles. Probably Lippincott’s
statements are nearest to the truth, but
none of them claim to be absolute measurement.</p>

</p>

<p>Why does Christmas always fall on the same day of

learned persons without receiving a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Buscando.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Christ was crucified on Friday, the
14th day of the Jewish month Nisan, and rose
from the dead on the following Sunday. The
14th of Nisan was the Jewish “passover,” the
day observed by them in commemoration of the
sprinkling of their door-posts with the blood of
the paschal lamb on the night when the “Destroying
Angel” passed over the dwellings of the Israelites
but smote the first-born of the Egyptians.
As the year of the Jews is a lunar year,
and the 14th of Nisan is always a full-moon day,
the Christian Church, regarding the observance of
the crucifixion of Christ as a substitute for the
passover of the Jewish Church, determine Good
Friday and Easter Sunday by the rules for reckoning
the Jewish ecclesiastical year. Christmas,
intended to commemorate the birth of Christ,
had no connection with the ritual of the old
church, and, like some two or three hundred
other immovable feast days of the Church of
Rome, many of them birthdays of saints, it was
finally settled that it should be observed on a
given day of the common calendar.</p>

established in this country? Who was the first advocate
of them? When did they become general?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Henry Butler.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—A law was passed in Massachusetts
in 1649 requiring every township to maintain a
free school, and every town of 100 families to
maintain a grammar school to “fit youths for the
university;” and it is recorded in 1665 that a free
school was then supported by each town in New
England. The Connecticut, Plymouth, and New
Haven Colonies soon followed this good example
of Massachusetts, either in whole or in part. The
first public school in Pennsylvania was established
in Philadelphia by the Quakers, in 1689, free to
those who could not pay. In 1694 Maryland
enacted that every county should have a public
school, and every parish a free library of at least
fifty volumes. A free grammar school was
established in New York by an act
passed in 1702, but a system of free
common schools was not inaugurated
in this State until after 1795, in which year,
on the recommendation of Governor Clinton, the
Legislature appropriated $50,000 to encourage
the establishment of common schools—not wholly
free. It was years after this before the system
of schools free to all (except colored children)
went into general operation in New York, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan.
The Southern States waited until after the war
before adopting the free-school system even for
white children. Their common schools were free
only for the children of confessed paupers. Who
was “the first advocate” of free schools it is now
impossible to determine positively. Several of
them came over in the Mayflower, as there were a
few free schools in Massachusetts before the
above enactment of 1649, making it obligatory
on every town to have them, the chief argument
then being that “every child must know how to
read the Bible.”</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Cordova, situated about fifty-seven

city of 6,500 to 7,000 inhabitants. The district
around it is very fertile, and the tobacco, sugar,
coffee, and cotton produced here foster an increasing

well paved; most of the houses are built of stone,
and the fine cathedral is much admired for its interior
architecture and decorations. The city was
founded by the early Spanish adventurers and
missionaries on the site of an old Aztec town, and
named in honor of the forerunner of Cortez,
Francisco Fernandez de Cordova, the discoverer
of Yucatan and the southeastern extremity of
Mexico, in the year 1517. The date of the first

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">W. P. Jacks.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—He was Francis Edward James
Keith, a Scotch nobleman, born at Inverngie Castle,
Aberdeenshire, in 1696. He and his elder
brother, the Earl Marischal, espoused the cause
of the “Elder Pretender,” as he is called, James
Francis Edward, son of the deposed James II. of
England, in the insurrection of 1715. That affair
ended in speedy disaster, and being attainted of
treason, he fled to France. Here after some two
years, spent for the most part in study at the
University of Paris, he took part in the disastrous
expedition of the Pretender to the highlands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Scotland in 1719. Escaping again to France, he
lived in obscurity and want, first at Paris and
then at Madrid, until he received a colonel’s commission
in the army of the King of Spain. Here
his Protestantism stood in the way of his promotion,
and he soon took a recommendation from
the King to Peter II. of Russia, in whose service
he soon rose to the rank of general. In 1747 he
entered the service of Frederick the Great of
Prussia, who made him a field marshal, accounting
him one of his ablest generals. Quick to discern
the military exigencies and opportunities of
the moment, and prompt to avail himself of them,
“sagacious, skillful, imperturbable, without fear
and without noise, a man quietly ever ready,” as
Carlyle describes him, he had the full confidence,
and even won the affection, of Frederick, who
was wont to place him in the most responsible
positions. He was killed Oct. 14, 1758, in the
battle of Hochkirch, in which Frederick the
Great suffered one of the most terrible defeats of
that bloody war at the hands of the combined
Austrian and Prussian armies.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The total population of Ireland in
1881 was 5,159,839. The total number of national
schools in 1880 was 7,590, with 1,083,020
pupils, aided by a parliamentary grant of £722,366,
or about $3,611,830. The population of
Great Britain proper—England, Wales and Scotland—was
29,703,859 in 1881, and the number
of public schools inspected in 1880 was 20,670,
with an attendance of 3,155,534 pupils. The
parliamentary grant amounted to £2,468,077, or
about $12,340,385, so that the parliamentary
grant in aid of primary education in Ireland is
about 70 cents per capita of the total population,
while for England, Wales and Scotland it is only
about 41 cents. The above figures cover only the
national schools for elementary instruction, in
addition to which there are hundreds of parochial,
or denominational and private schools in both
countries. In Ireland, in 1880, there were 158
workhouse schools under the superintendency
of the National Board, with
an enrollment of 16,945, and an average
attendance of 8,880. There were fifty-two industrial
schools in 1879, with 4,979 inmates.
There were in 1880, ninety-four school farms,
nineteen school gardens, and a large number of
agricultural schools under local management.
The total number of pupils who entered the examination
in agriculture in 1880 was 33,648, of
whom 15,652 passed. The statistics of industrial
schools in England, Wales, and Scotland are
not conveniently obtainable.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">W. C. Colgrove.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—A little more than half of the earth’s
surface is illuminated by the sun at any given
moment. There is a very slight extension of the
area of illumination for the reason you mention,
and beyond that an extension of from thirty-five
to forty miles all around on account of horizontal
refraction. If you put a silver coin into a bowl,
then stand back until the edge barely hides the
coin, and while you keep this same position another
person fills the bowl with water, you will
see the bottom of it seem to lift until the coin
comes into sight. This is because the rays of
light reflected from the bottom of the bowl are
bent out of a straight line in passing through the
water and out into the thinner medium, the air.
This is called refraction. The rays of light from
the setting sun are bent downward in a similar
manner as they enter the earth’s atmosphere,
and so the sun appears to be above the horizon a
little more than two minutes after it has actually
dropped below the true horizon. A difference of
two minutes in time corresponds to a distance
of thirty miles on the earth’s surface.</p>

is Parliament constituted?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A. C. Starin.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Like the Congress of the United
States, the British Parliament legislates for the
whole nation. But, in addition to this, it takes
the place of the separate legislative bodies that
used to exist in Scotland and Ireland, and makes
local laws for England, Wales, Scotland, and
Ireland, such as in this country can only be made
by State Legislatures. As regards the Dominion
of Canada, the Australian Provinces, and other
colonial possessions, with legislatures of their
own, the powers of Parliament are somewhat
analogous to those of Congress over the States.
2. Parliament is composed of two houses, the
Lords and the Commons. The House of
Lords consists of peers who hold their seats
either by virtue of hereditary right; by creation
of the sovereign (who is unrestricted in his power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
of creating peers); by virtue of office, as the English
bishops; by election for life, as the Irish
peers; or by election for duration of Parliament,
as the Scottish peers. This House, in the session
of 1882, consisted of 516 members, of whom 5
were peers of the blood royal, 2 were archbishops,
22 were dukes, 19 marquises, 117 earls, 26 viscounts,
24 bishops, 257 barons, 16 Scottish peers,
and 28 Irish representative peers. More than
two-thirds of these hereditary peerages have been
created within the present century—over one-third
of them by the present sovereign, which
marks one of the strongest factors of the power
of the Crown. In the same year the Commons
consisted of 639 members, classified as “knights
of the shire,” or representatives of counties;
“citizens,” or representatives of cities; and “burgesses,”
or representatives of boroughs—all of
whom hold office by election. The qualifications
of electors were given in an article published in
Our Curiosity Shop a few months ago. The total
number of these electors in 1882 was 3,134,801.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There was no official charge or imputation
of dishonesty against Chester A. Arthur
when in the New York Custom House. His administration
of that office was a great improvement
on any preceding one for many years back.
He had effected great reforms and ousted officers
who had fattened on corruption under his predecessors.
President Hayes distinctly disclaimed
any want of faith in Mr. Arthur’s integrity as a
cause for replacing him, and the official reports of
Secretary Sherman bore unequivocal testimony to
the efficiency of the Collector’s administration of
his difficult office, and clearly recognized his personal
integrity. Mr. Arthur did not approve certain
changes which Secretary Sherman wished to
make, and he was known also to be in sympathy
with Mr. Conkling and others not favorable to
Secretary Sherman’s aspirations for the Presidency.
It is generally believed that the above
were the chief reasons for the Secretary’s desire
to supersede Mr. Arthur, which finally prevailed.</p>

Roger Bacon.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A. Buckholz.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Roger Bacon was an English monk
of penetrating intellect, who by his scientific investigations
and writings greatly advanced the
cause of science in a time when the study of nature
had been supplanted by the theological
disputations and philosophical speculations
of the “schoolmen.” He was born near
Ilchester, England, in the year 1214, of a
respectable family. He graduated at Oxford
and Paris, and, entering the order of
Franciscan monks, settled at Oxford, where he
devoted himself to the study of physics. His discoveries
were looked upon as wonderful by the
ignorant, and were made the means by his clerical
brethren of bringing him into disfavor with the
Pope, who deprived him of his professorship.
He was imprisoned for some years, until the elevation
of Clement II. to the Papal throne. Despite
the Franciscan interdiction, Clement requested
Bacon to send him his writings, and, in answer,
John of London became the bearer to the Pope of
“Opus Majus” and two other works. For ten years
Bacon was at liberty, but in 1278 he was again
imprisoned, and the reading of his works forbidden.
Through the intercession of many influential
English noblemen, his release was
granted shortly before his death, which occurred
in 1292 or 1294. He wrote much, but several of
his works have not been printed. Chief among
his inventions was the magnifying glass, and his
superior knowledge won for him the title, “Doctor
Mirabilis.” He sought to know nature through the
study of mathematics and by investigation. He
pointed out the errors in the calendar, growing
out of the old style of reckoning, long before Pope
Gregory instituted the present calendar. As a
Latin writer, his style was elegant and forcible;
as a scientific scholar, he was fully two centuries
in advance of his age; as a man, his character was
pure and noble.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—George Gordon, Lord Byron, was
born in London in the year 1788, and at the age
of 11 succeeded to the title and estate of his
grand uncle, William, Lord Byron, near Nottingham.
In 1807, two years after entering Trinity
College, he published his first volume of poems,
entitled “Hours of Idleness.” Stung by the sarcastic
criticism on these poems by Lord Brougham
in the Edinburgh <cite>Review</cite>, he soon after
wrote “English Bards and Scotch Reviewers,” a
scathing satire, and at once sailed for Turkey and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
Greece. “Childe Harold” and a few shorter
poems were written between the years 1812 and
1818. After a year of riotous living in Italy he
sailed for Greece in 1823, and took a conspicuous
part in the struggle for Greek independence. In
this he succeeded so far as to restore comparative
order to the disorganized army, but his health
soon began to fail, and exposure to a storm induced
a fever which terminated his life, April 10,
1824. His body was interred in the Huckwall
church-yard, being denied admission to Westminster
Abbey. Byron undoubtedly possessed
great genius and wrote many beautiful and ennobling
poems, but his restless and passionate
temper and the immorality of his life tainted
most of what he wrote and debarred him from the
list of really great English poets. In descriptive
power, fervor, imagery, and melody his powers
were marvelous, and many passages in his writings
are unsurpassed in these respects by anything
in the English language.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="smcap">Beloit</span>, Wis.<br>
</p>

<p>What is meant by “tin and terne plates,” and what
is the gist of the demand of the “American Tinned
Plate Association” for an increase of the duty on these
plates?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—“Tin plates” are plates of sheet-iron
or soft steel, coated with tin, used chiefly for
making household and dairy utensils, and for
cans of all sorts. “Terne plates” are iron or soft
steel sheets, coated with mixed lead and tin, used
for roofing and similar purposes. About 95 to
98 per cent of these products are iron or steel, the
tin and lead coating constituting the remaining 2
to 5 per cent. Soft steel is used chiefly now, because
the quality required can be made cheaper
than in iron, is more homogeneous and solid, and
less liable to blister in the tinning processes. The
association above named claims that the British
plates imported to this country are “of poor quality,
meanly coated, and, if low priced, are wasteful
in the end.” That if home manufacture of
such plates were encouraged by as heavy a tariff
as is put upon other forms of finished iron—say
50 per cent, instead of only 15 to
30 per cent, as at present—American
competition would act in this case as it has done
in other classes of “protected industry,” to improve
the qualities and ultimately to reduce the
actual cost of the goods. But it is not only in
these respects that it would benefit the country,
says this association, but in bringing out the
buried resources of our own mines and increasing
the home market for American goods and
American labor. The extra cost of American labor
is, after all, accounted for mainly by the better
manner of living of American laborers; their
earnings are distributed among the American
consumers of their wares, instead of being sent
abroad to pay foreign laborers, while the native
products utilized are so much clear gain. The
tin, a small percentage of the sheets as above
shown, would be imported to this country directly
from Australia or the Dutch East Indies
and “Straits Settlements,” but aside from this the
materials used would be American products. In
1882 there were 480,596,480 pounds of British
tin and terne plates sold in the United States, valued
at $18,000,000 at Liverpool, and costing about
$2,000,000 more for transportation. For this tin
the American consumers paid about $30,000,000.
To produce this in the United States would cost
about as follows:</p>

for him Saint Simonians. He entered the American
army in 1778, at 18 years of age, and served
therein with distinction and honor. While returning
to his native land he was captured by
British seamen and carried to Jamaica, where he
remained until 1783. When at length he reached
France he won many disciples to his socialistic
views, and before his death, in 1823, he wrote
several works upon philosophy and social reform.
His greatest work was the ‘Nouveau Christianisme’
(New Christianity), in which he embodies his
final and complete design for the amelioration of
the poor and the preservation of society. He advocates
a social hierarchy, controlling and regulating
the choice of vocations, the fixing of salaries,
the division of heritages, whose chief aim it
shall be “to make the labors of each conduce to
the good of all;” and to aid his projects he advised

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—This calamity occurred on Sunday
afternoon, May 4, 1873, resulting in the death
from drowning and injuries of over forty men,
women, and children, and the serious injury of
nearly forty others. Its immediate cause was
the overcrowding of the bridge by spectators of
an immersion service of the Baptist Church of
that city. The real cause was the faulty construction
of the bridge, which was an iron structure,
known as a Truesdell truss. It was a wagon and
root bridge of five spans, each about 120 feet
long. Both shore spans fell into the water
while the three middle ones, resting entirely
upon stone piers, remained suspended by the
wrought-iron members of the main cords from
six to eight feet below their proper place, dropped
down between the piers. The number of persons
on the first span that went down was variously
estimated to be from 150 to 200, representing a
weight of not more than 30,000 pounds. A
Truesdell bridge, erected over Fox River at Elgin,
fell in December, 1868. This was rebuilt by Mr.
Truesdell. On Monday, July 5, 1869, a crowd of
about 300 persons gathered on the bridge to witness
a tub race, when the east span, 68 feet in
length, fell, precipitating about one hundred men,
women, and children into the water. Fortunately
the stream was but about four feet deep at this
time, and no persons were drowned and but two
or three deaths followed from injuries received.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The divisions of time established by
geologists are based upon the formations of strata
and the advents of different forms of animal life.
The history of the earth is divided into five “eras,”
seven “ages,” twenty-two “periods,” and the last
two periods are subdivided into seven epochs.
These divisions, proceeding from the fifth downward
to the first, are as follows: 5. Psychozoic
era, age of man, human period, and recent epoch.
4. Cenozoic era, age of mammals—embracing the
quaternary period, which comprehends the terrace,
Champlain, and glacial epochs, and the tertiary
period, which comprehends the pliocene,
miocene, and eocene epochs. 3. Mesozoic, or middle,
era, the age of reptiles, the cretaceous, jurassic,
and triassic periods. 2. Paleozoic era, the
carboniferous age, or age of acrogens and amphibians;
the Devonian age, or age of fishes; the
silurian age, or age of invertebrates, or mollusks—the
names of the fourteen periods into which
these ages are divided are not in common use.
1. Archaean, or eozoic era; the archaean age, and
the Huronian and Laurentian periods. For an
explanation of the terms used in this division
consult Webster’s or Worcester’s unabridged dictionaries,
and study the clear illustration accompanying
the word “Geology” in the former work.</p>

<p>Is it true that in the Andersonville prison pen, during

creek had become very scarce and foul and the captive
Unionists were dying from this cause, a spring
suddenly burst out of the hillside? If this is a fact,
state some of the particulars, giving the date of the
occurrence.</p>

<p class="right">
H. W.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It is a fact, and, whether it was a
“special providence” or not, as most, if not all, of
those wretched prisoners believed, it served
all the purposes of one, as much as the
miracle in the desert of Sinai, when Moses
smote the rock, and the waters
gushed forth which saved the thirst-stricken
hosts of Israel. Of the origin of this spring John
McElroy, who spent fourteen months in Southern
prison pens, gives substantially the following account:
“Toward the end of August, 1864, the
water in the creek was indescribably bad. Before
the stream entered the stockade it was rendered
too filthy for any use by the contaminations from
the camp of the guards, situated about half a
mile above. Immediately upon entering the
stockade its pollution became terrible. The
oozy seep at the bottom of the hillsides drained
directly into it all the filth from a population of
33,000. Imagine the condition of an open sewer
through the heart of a city of that many people,
and receiving all the offensive products of so
dense a population into a shallow, sluggish
stream a yard wide and five inches deep, heated
by the burning rays of the sun at the thirty-second
parallel of latitude.’ The prisoners dug wells
in the swampy earth with their pocket-knives to
a depth of 20 to 30 feet, pulling up the earth in
pantaloon-legs. But a drought came on and these
wells, which at the best were not free from
pollution, began to fail. To approach too close,
even by a hair’s breadth, to the “dead-line” on the
west side of the stockade, where the creek entered,
in the effort to get water as free from
filth as possible, was to sign one’s death warrant,
which the whizzing bullet of the heartless guard
executed instantly. “More wicked and unjustifiable
murders were never committed than those
almost daily assassinations at the creek,” says
the historian. Sickness had multiplied in this
horrible prison-pen until the wretched victims of
such barbarism sat face to face with despair
constantly. At this awful extremity what was
the astonishment and gratitude of the camp one
morning, when it was discovered that “during
the night a large, bold spring had burst out on
the north side, about midway between the swamp
and the summit of the hill, and pouring out was a
grateful flood of pure, sweet water, in an apparently
exhaustless quantity.” This was the
morning of Aug. 13, 1864. The overjoyed Union
prisoners christened it “Providence spring,” the
fitting name by which it is still known.</p>

Madame Dudevant the now famous nom de plume
of “George Sand?” Why did she take that name?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Alice.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Leonard Sylvain Jules Sandeau, a
French novelist and dramatic writer of some distinction,
was born at Anbusson, France, Feb. 19,
1811. He studied law in Paris, but subsequently
turned his attention to literature. In 1831 he
became acquainted with Madame Dudevant, who
lived with him in three small rooms in the Quai
Saint Michel at a yearly rental of 300
francs. She it was who induced
him to enter upon a literary career. In 1832 they
produced together “Rose et Blanche,” a novel in
five volumes, signed “Jules Sand.” It was received
by the public with encouraging favor. Before
she returned to Nahant she conferred with
Sandeau respecting a new romance, each of them
to write half of it. Fearing that he would neglect
the work when she was not at hand to spur
him to his task, she wrote the whole of “Indiana,”
published the same year, in which her splendid
genius rose far above anything in “Rose et
Blanche.” Returning to Paris, she found that
Sandeau had not written a line. Handing him
her manuscript, she exclaimed: “Read that.” He
did so, and declared it to be such a masterpiece
that he could not review it. She wished to retain
the name of “Jules Sands,” but as he had taken
no part in the work, he positively declined to allow
it. Appealing to their mutual friend, De
Larouche, he advised her to take for a Christian
name the name of the patron saint of the day, St.
George, retaining the name “Sands,” a piece of
advice which she instantly adopted. M. Sandeau
afterward produced numerous novels and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
dramas, conspicuous among which are “Mdlle.
de la Sergliere,” in two volumes, 1848, dramatized
in 1851—generally esteemed his best novel; “La
Maison de Penarvan,” 1858, dramatized in 1858;
“Le Gendre de M. Poirier,” written in connection
with Emil Angier, 1854—his best comedy. In
1853 he became keeper of the Mazurin Library,

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph, Archduke
of Austria, younger brother of Francis Joseph
I., the present Emperor of Austria-Hungary,
and now generally referred to as the Emperor
Maximilian I. of Mexico, was born in 1832.
He was liberally educated, with a mind enriched
by extensive reading, wide travel, and intercourse
with many of the leading spirits of Europe. In
1857, on July 27, he married the sister of the
present King of the Belgians, Charlotte Marie
Amelie, born June 7, 1840. This amiable, beautiful,
and highly intellectual lady was reared by
her father, Leopold I., of Belgium, the most progressive
of European sovereigns, with the greatest
care, until she adorned every court she moved
in. In 1861, taking advantage of the troubled
condition of Mexico and the civil war in the
United States, France, Spain, and Great Britain
commenced hostilities against Mexico, ostensibly
to enforce certain pecuniary claims. But in
1862, when the real purpose of the French manifested
itself, the British and Spanish forces withdrew,
and the French declared war, proclaiming
the intention to liberate the Mexican people from
the tyranny of their President, Benito Juarez.
They overran the eastern and central part of
Mexico, captured the capital—receiving more or
less support from the clerical party among the
natives—and finally set up a provisional government,
headed nominally by General Almonte, but
really under dictation of the invaders. An “Assembly
of Notables,” so called, convened at Mexico,
July 10, 1863, decided by a vote of 281 to 19 in
favor of a “limited hereditary monarchy,” with a
Catholic prince for sovereign, under the title of Emperor.
At the instigation of Napoleon, who had
already begun to realize the folly of his undertaking
to subdue the whole of Mexico and hold it
in subjection to his own will, seeing that the Republicans
of Mexico were still organized and were
continually harrassing the usurpers, the scepter
of this new government was proffered to Maximilian.
Not until all but the four northern provinces
were in possession of the French forces and
their Mexican recruits did he accept this uneasy
crown. On May 29, 1864, the Emperor and Empress
landed at Vera Cruz and on June 12 they
made their public entry into the capital amid a
brilliant military and civic display, accompanied
by many signs of popular welcome. Before winter
the Imperialists had gained possession of all
the chief places in every State in the so-called
empire. However, the fugitive President of the
desperate republic still maintained a species of
guerilla warfare in various places, and the
sympathies of the people of the United States
were with them. No sooner was the great civil
war in this country ended than this sympathy
began to make itself felt very sensibly. On Nov.
6, 1865, Secretary Seward directed the American
Minister at Paris to represent to Napoleon III.
that the presence of the French army in Mexico
was a “cause of grave reflection to the government
of the United States,” and that the latter
could on no account allow the establishment of
an imperial government, based on foreign aid, in
that country, or recognize there any other than
republican institutions. This increased the unpopularity
of the war in France. Napoleon took
warning, and in the summer of 1866 withdrew
his forces. Deserted by his European allies,
Maximilian’s empire hastened to a most melancholy
end, so far as himself and the Empress
were concerned. Charlotte went to Europe to enlist
aid, but in vain. Her husband’s perilous position,
added to the bitter disappointment and
mortification of her failure, at last dethroned her
reason. Maximilian refused to leave with the
last French detachment, though urged to do so.
He felt bound in honor to remain and share the
fate of his Mexican supporters. At the head of
10,000 men he made a brave defense of Queretaro
against the republicans under General Escobedo.
On the night of May 14, 1867, the
stronghold of his position was betrayed into the
hands of his foes by the Emperor’s most trusted
friend, General Lopez. Even then he refused the
opportunity proffered him by his immediate captor
to escape in civilian’s dress, lest it might
compromise this generous foe. Along with Generals
Miramon and Mejia, he was tried by court-martial,
and on the 19th of July the three were
shot. “Poor Carlotta,” as she is sorrowfully
called, has never fully recovered her reason, although
cared for with the greatest tenderness by
her royal brother.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—As shown in the table of United
States silver coins now obtainable only at a high
premium, which has already been given in Our
Curiosity Shop, the “boss dollar,” the rarest of
all, is that of 1804, price $400 to $500, according
to condition; the “boss half-dollar” is that of
1796, with sixteen stars, price $20 to $27.50—although
that of 1796, with only fifteen stars,
and that of 1797, each command nearly the same
premium; $20 to $25. The “boss quarter-dollars”
are those of 1823 and 1827, each quoted
at $15 to $25. The “boss dime” is that of 1804,
quoted at $4 to $6. The “boss half-dime” is that
of 1802, worth $25 to $40. The “boss cent,” the
rarest of all the cents, is that of 1799, quoted at
$4 to $6; a higher rate of premium even than
that of the “boss dollar.” The “boss half-cent”
is that of 1796, worth $5 to $8, or from one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
thousand to sixteen hundred per cent more than

<p><em>Answer.</em>—This mild expression for “I won’t

but is undoubtedly borrowed from Ecclesiastes,
chapter x, verse 29: “Curse not the King, no,
not in thy thoughts: and curse not the rich in
thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry
the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">William Yale.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—An immense aerolite, or meteoric
stone, fell near Ægospatami, in Asia Minor, in
467 B. C., which was described by Pliny as being
as large as a wagon. There is a remarkable one
in the Smithsonian Institution, weighing 1,400
pounds, which fell in Mexico about A. D. 1500.
The largest meteoric masses on record were
heard of first by Captain Ross, the Arctic explorer,
through some Esquimaux. These lay on
the west coast of Greenland, where they were
subsequently found by the Swedish Exploring
Expedition of 1870. One of them, now in the
Royal Museum of Stockholm, weighs over
50,000 pounds, and is the largest specimen known.
Two remarkable meteorites have fallen
in Iowa within a few years past. On
Feb. 12, 1875, a very brilliant meteor,
in the form of an elongated horseshoe, was seen
throughout a region of at least 400 miles in
length and 250 breadth, lying in Missouri and
Iowa. It is described as “without a tail but having
a sort of flowing jacket of flame. Detonations
were heard, so violent as to shake the earth and
to jar the windows like the shock of an earthquake,”
as it fell, at about 10:30 o’clock p. m., a
few miles east of Marengo, Iowa. The ground
for a space of some seven miles in length by two
to four miles in breadth was strewn with fragments
of this meteor, varying in weight from a
few ounces to seventy-four pounds; the aggregate
of the parts discovered being about five
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>On May 10, 1879, at about 5 o’clock p. m., a
large and extraordinarily luminous meteor exploded
with a terrific noise, followed at slight intervals
with less violent detonations, and struck
the earth in the edge of a ravine, near Estherville,
Emmet County, Iowa, penetrating to a depth of
fourteen feet. Within two miles other fragments
were found, one of which weighed 170 pounds
and another 32 pounds. The principal mass
weighed 431 pounds. All the discovered parts
aggregate about 640 pounds. The one of 170
pounds is now in the cabinet of the State University
of Minnesota. The composition of this
aerolite is peculiar in many respects; but, as in
nearly all aerolites, there is a considerable proportion
of iron and nickel.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There is an old story that a soldier
once wrote to his mother, who complained of her
unhappiness, asking her to get some sewing
done by some one who had no care or trouble.
Coming in her search to one who, she thought,
must be content and happy, this lady took her to
a closet containing a human skeleton. “Madam,”
said she, “I try to keep my sorrows to myself,
but know that every night I am compelled by
my husband to kiss this skeleton of him who was
once his rival. Think you, then, I can be happy?”
The inference is certainly too clear to need interpretation.</p>

<p>What was the amount of the Confederate debt at the
close of the war? Was their currency a legal tender
for all debts? How much did they issue? How much,
if any, remained in the Confederate treasury at the
close of the war?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Casey and Underhill.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—1. According to the “Rise and Fall of
the Confederate Government,” by Jefferson Davis,
the foreign debt of the Confederate States at the
close of the war was £2,200,000, or about $11,000,000.
Besides this, the debt at home, on the
books of the Register of the Treasury on Oct. 1
1864, amounted to $1,147,970,208. Davis estimates
that balances in the hands of absent officers
would have reduced the total public debt to
$1,126,381,095, of which $541,340,090 consisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
of funded debt and the balance unfunded
debt, or treasury notes. What further
debt was created between Oct. 1, 1864,
and the downfall of the Confederacy in April,
1865, it is not easy to ascertain. Judging
from the expenditure of the six months next preceding
Oct. 1, 1864, the debt must have been increased
at least $450,000,000. Davis says:
“The appropriations called for by the different
departments for the six months ending June 30,
1865, amounted to $438,416,504,” which, taken
together with the amount of unexpended appropriations
and the small proportion raised by taxation,
confirms our estimate, so that the total
home and foreign debt of the Confederacy at the
close of the war, omitting any claims for advances
made by individual States, must
have been about $1,587,000,000. 2. The
treasury notes of the Confederacy were
made receivable for all public debts or taxes except
export duty on cotton. The terms of at
least one issue, as given by Mr. Davis, “receivable
for all debts or taxes except the export
duty on cotton,” would constitute them a legal
tender. 3. In December, 1863, this currency in
circulation in those States amounted to “more
than $600,000,000.” A considerable part of this
was funded in Confederate bonds, but new issues
or reissues swelled the amount again to about the
old figures before the war closed. 4. Just how
much specie remained in the hands of
the Secretary of the Confederate Treasury when
Johnston surrendered is not known, but it must
have been a trifling sum; for when Jefferson
Davis committed the treasury chest to General
Joe Johnston’s safe-keeping, according to that
officer’s statement on pages 408 and 409 of his
“Narrative of the Rebellion,” it contained but
$39,000 in silver, a considerable part of which
he took and divided among his troops. The fleeing
members of the Cabinet, no doubt, got away
with the most of the gold and foreign bills.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—We are indebted to Mr. W. F. Slater,
of Hyde Park, for the following reply to this inquiry:
During the Jackson and Van Buren administrations
the party used the hickory pole and
broom as a Democratic emblem of victory. In
the memorable campaign of 1840 the Indianapolis
<cite>Sentinel</cite> (Democratic) was published, with
Mr. Nat Bolton as editor, and George Pattison as
assistant. In the town of Greenfield resided Mr.
Chapman, life-long Democrat, and at that time
the postmaster, but no connection with the Chapman
that subsequently published the <cite>Sentinel</cite>.
Mr. Chapman wrote a desponding letter to Pattison,
and Pattison, in his answer, endeavored to
encourage his fellow-townsman, and wound up
his letter with, “Crow, Chapman, crow!” The
letter fell into Whig hands and was published in
the campaign paper of the Whig party, <cite>The Spirit
of 1876</cite>. In 1842 and 1844, when the Whig
party met with defeat, the rooster came into universal
use as the Democratic emblem of victory.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">BEE-SWARMING.</p>

<p>H. J. Dunlap, Esq., of Champaign, Ill., who has
made bee-culture a study, after a few words of
comment on the brief answer given to “Topsy’s”
question on the swarming of bees, published in
Our Curiosity Shop three or four weeks ago,
gives us his own views on this subject as follows:</p>

<p>New brood is hatched early in the season—in
case of plentiful stores before the earliest blossoms—while
the first swarm may not leave the
hive until July, or even later; the condition of
the honey flowers in bloom having much to do in
determining the time. [In the Southern States it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
often leaves in April or May, and in this latitude
usually in May or June.—<span class="smcap">Ed</span>]. The first swarm
is composed of old and young bees indiscriminately,
and of drones. In from six to ten days
a young queen is hatched. Sometimes several
hatch at the same time, but all are destroyed except
one, the queens engaging in deadly combat in
which one or the other is the victor. The bees
destroy the remaining queen cells as soon as a
queen is hatched. In a day or two the virgin
queen flies out to meet the male, or drone, and
after copulation returns to her hive, where she
usually remains until the next season, when she
leads out a swarm. In some seasons, when
honey is plenty, she may go out with a swarm,
and even third swarms are thrown off, but such
seasons are almost certain to be poor ones for
honey, the swarms becoming so depleted in number
that they are unable to avail themselves
of the later blossoms, even if these are well-stored
with honey. The second swarm thrown
off will necessarily be composed mostly of young
bees, but the inference that swarming continues
so long as there are young queens to lead them
out is erroneous.</p>

<p>Two men had a hearing about a claim within the
limits of the railroad land grant, and the General
Land Office decided that neither could hold it. One
of the parties procured from the Northern Pacific
Railroad a relinquishment, which was sent to the General

Now, had the Northern Pacific Railroad the right
to relinquish its title in this way? Please give the law.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">David Evans.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—By an act of Congress approved
June 22, 1874, according to the statement of
“Copps’ American Settler’s Guide,” it is provided
that in the adjustment of all railroad land grants,
whether made directly to any State for railroad
purposes, or to any corporation, if any of the
lands granted be found in the possession of an
actual settler, whose entry or filing has been allowed
under the pre-emption or homestead laws
subsequent to the time at which, by the decision
of the Land Office, the right of said road was declared
to have attached to such lands, the grantees,
upon a proper relinquishment of the lands
so entered or filed for, shall be entitled to select
an equal quantity of other lands in lieu thereof
from any of the public lands not mineral,
and within the limits of the grant, not
otherwise appropriated at the date of selection.
And any such entries or filings thus relieved from
conflict may be perfected into complete titles as
if such lands had not been granted. Lands so
relinquished are rated at only $1.25 per acre. An
inducement is thus offered to railroad companies
to relinquish in favor of the settlers, and receive
other lands in lieu of those surrendered. Not
only this, but when the superior right of the
company is ascertained, and it is found that the
claim of the settler is such that it would be admitted
were the railroad claim extinguished, the
General Land Office will, in all practicable cases,
direct the attention of the officers of the company
to the fact, and request an explicit answer
whether or not the land will be relinquished. At
the same time it is well for the party interested to
seek for himself the relief indicated, by direct application
to the railroad authorities, and thereby
aid in securing a speedy adjustment.</p>

<p>How are torpedoes, for blowing up vessels, constructed
and used?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Charles G. Boone.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There are several kinds of naval torpedoes.
They may be classed, as fixed—submarine
mines—and locomotive. Of the first sort
there are two classes, viz., the self-acting and those
which must be exploded by the electric battery
operated from the shore or some other means of
direct ignition.</p>

<p>An example of the self-acting sort may be described
as follows: Take a hollow iron cone; fill
this in part with gunpowder, say 150 to 250
pounds, but not enough to overcome the buoyancy
of the cone. In the top of this charge of
gunpowder bury an iron case containing lime,
and in it a thin glass tube filled with sulphuric
acid. Connect this tube or vial with an iron rod
running through the top of the torpedo cone, up
to within a short distance of the surface of the
water. From this upright rod let other rods,
called feelers, extend horizontally in every direction;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
let the whole be anchored in the channel to
be defended, so that these feelers will be so
near to the surface that passing vessels will be
likely to come in contact with one or more of
them; in which case the shock will break the
frail glass tube containing the sulphuric acid,
which latter, acting chemically on the lime, will
instantly generate sufficient heat to explode the
charge and destroy the vessel. For a sample of
the other class of fixed torpedoes, imagine a
submarine magazine filled with gunpowder, or—better
still for this purpose, gun-cotton, because
water does not injure it—planted in a channel,
connected with the shore by an insulated copper
wire attached to a battery. Let a small piece of
wire be soldered to the metal case of the torpedo,
and unite this, in the priming chamber, with
the shore wire by a fine piece of platinum. The
moment the operator on shore connects the wire
with the battery the current, meeting the resistance
of this contracted bridge of platinum, heats
it to incandescence and explodes the charge. By
planting several parallel lines of such torpedoes
across a channel, at no great distance apart, in
such a way that the mines in one row stand
opposite the open spaces in another, it is rendered
extremely hazardous for a hostile vessel to
attempt to pass. Of the locomotive submarine
explosives, one of the most formidable is the
Whitehead fish torpedo, the construction of
which is more or less a secret, sold by the inventor
to the English, Austrian, and Russian
navies. The shape of the case is, as the name
implies, that of a fish, and it is propelled by a
screw driven by compressed air. From a peculiar
carriage on shore, or more frequently on
board a vessel, it is discharged in a direct line
for the enemy’s ship, and is exploded by impact.
It is a terribly destructive engine when it happens
to strike, but its aim is uncertain. The
American torpedo, of similar description in many
respects, Harvey’s, is believed to be a more reliable
and effective engine.</p>

<p>Finally there is the torpedo used to
such good advantage in several instances during
our late war, particularly in the case of the
sinking of the rebel ram Albemarle. It is rigged
on the end of a spar carried in the bow of a
launch, and sometimes on outriggers on either
side, and is exploded by contact with the vessel
to be destroyed, at some point several feet below
the water-line.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There is no good ground for
dispute over the question as to how Virginia
got its name. This name was given by Queen
Elizabeth at the request of Sir Walter Raleigh to
the region discovered in 1584 by persons sent out
by him. It was applied to what is now North
Carolina, and was extended, with the progress of
exploration, over the country northward as far as
the present city of Bangor, Me., or to the 45th
degree of north latitude, and southward to the
34th parallel. One colony after another was
carved out of the original Virginia until it was reduced
to the boundaries it had at the time of the
Revolutionary war. It claimed jurisdiction over
all the Northwest territory by virtue of its first
charter, made to the London company, and by
conquest from Great Britain during the war; but
it ceded all its rights to the Federal Government
in 1787, reserving only 3,709,848 acres to reward
Virginia troops.</p>

immigration law was it that our government
forced its way into China at the cannon’s mouth?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The first American treaty with
China was made at Wang-hia, a suburb of Macao,
July 3, 1844, by the Hon. Caleb Cushing, Minister
Plenipotentiary for the United States, and
Commissioner Ki-ying, on the part of the Chinese.
It was soon after the close of the Anglo-Chinese
war known as the “Opium war,” because
it grew out of the persistent smuggling of opium
into China by the East India Company, and resulted
in the agreement of the Chinese Government
to admit opium as an article of legitimate
commerce. It also resulted in the opening of five
ports to English trade. Thus the forcing of the
Chinese “at the cannon’s mouth” was done by
the English, against a sincere desire of
the former both to keep out opium and to
have nothing more to do with Europeans
that they could possibly help. The negotiations
between Mr. Cushing and Ki-ying were amicable
and highly creditable to both nations from first to
last. Strange to say, to the utter astonishment of
the English, Mr. Cushing, with the arguments of
reason only, gained many important concessions
not contained in the British treaty, besides all
that was conceded in that instrument. The next
treaty between the United States and China was
signed at Tientsin, China, June 15, 1858. It contained
a number of important additional concessions,
all obtained without any violence or serious
warlike demonstration on the part of our own
government, but coincident with the English and
French treaties extorted from the Chinese
by the bloody war that had been waged
for the two preceding years. Had not the
English and French waged that war it is quite
certain that neither they nor the Americans would
have gained any new concessions, and they
might have had to yield some of those granted
in the old treaties. But having been forced
to make concessions to their hated
foes, it must be said that the Chinese
Government yielded to Americans equal
rights and privileges in a manner which showed
plainly that they had no desire to withhold anything
from a friendly power which they had
granted to their enemies. The first article of the
treaty recites, among other things: “There shall
be, as there always has been, peace and friendship
between the United States and the Ta-Tsing
(Chinese) Empire, and between their people respectively.
They shall not insult or oppress each
other,” etc. The next, known as the Burlingame
treaty, was negotiated at Washington and ratified
by the United States Senate July 16, 1868, when
Mr. Anson Burlingame was here at the head of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
the first Chinese Embassy to this country. It
was negotiated on the highest plane of American
statesmanship, and breathes throughout the
spirit of true republicanism, the spirit of the
highest Christian civilization. It is sad to think
that it was too high for the majority of our politicians
to stand on, and has been lowered and
narrowed to accommodate them in the present
treaty, negotiated in 1880, at the dictation of
Denis Kearney and the Sinophobists of California.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—He was born at Cologne in 1807. He
was well educated, served for a time in the army,
which he left in 1830 to connect himself with the
theater at Cologne, of which he became in time a
director. Much of his time was given to literature
and politics. In the latter he espoused the
cause of liberalism. This was particularly the
case after he moved to Leipsic, where he was first
a director of the theater, then a bookseller and
publisher. Here he founded the Schiller Society
of Leipsic, was connected with the German Catholic
movement, and was finally elected Vice President
of the Provisional Assembly at Frankfort in
1848. In the National Assembly he became
leader of the Left, or Radicals. He joined the
popular movement in 1848, took a prominent
part in the insurrection that broke out at Vienna
at the time of the struggle for Hungarian independence,
headed by Kossuth, and, being arrested,
he was summarily shot, Nov. 9, 1848.</p>

<p>When, where, and by whom was the cairn discovered
in which was the last record of Dr. John Franklin?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The cairn containing the written
record left by the Franklin exploring party was
discovered at Point Victory on the coast of King
William’s Island. This discovery was made in
1859 (fourteen years after Franklin’s death), by
Lieutenant Hobson of the British yacht Fox,
purchased and fitted out by Lady Franklin, and
commanded by Captain Leopold McClintock. The
principal facts stated in the record are that her
Majesty’s ships Terror and Erebus spent the winter
of 1845-6 at Beechey Island, off the southwest
coast of North Devon, having ascended
Wellington Channel to latitude 77 deg., and returned
by the west side of Cornwallis Island.
Lieutenant Gore and Charles F. De Voeux had
left the ships with six men, on an exploring expedition,
May 24, 1847, and on the 28th left this
written statement of their journeyings.
Franklin had sailed westward to longitude
98 deg., then up Wellington Channel—the
course specially commended to him, but upon
trying to reach the American coast he was prevented
by the masses of ice sweeping southward
through McClintock Channel. The record concludes
with these words, in the handwriting of
Captain Fitz James: “April 25, 1848—H. M.
ships Terror and Erebus were deserted on 22d
April, five leagues n. n. w. of this, having been
beset since 12th September, 1846. The officers
and crews, consisting of 105 souls, under the
command of Captain F. R. M. Crozier, landed
here in lat. 69 deg. 37 min. 42 sec. n., long. 98
deg. 41 min. w. Sir John Franklin died on the
11th June, 1847; and the total loss by deaths in
the expedition has been to this date 9 officers and
15 men.” Captain Crozier added the important
statement: “We shall start on to-morrow, 26th
April, 1848, for Back’s Fish River.” This record
proved the identity of Sir John Franklin’s party
with a party seen by the Esquimaux pressing
southward along Fish River to reach the settlements
of the Hudson Bay Company. Later
many skeletons were found on the south and west
coasts of King William’s Island. It is certain, according
to the recent reports of Captain Hall and
Lieutenant Schwatka, that all of the party perished
from hunger and exposure.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The best we can do is to give the elevations
of the barometers of the United States
Signal Service above sea-level at the several
points specified, as computed for that service.
That these are not certainly exact is admitted by
the Chief of the Signal Service, who says, on page<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
1,178 of his report for 1881: “When the elevations
of these planes above mean sea-level have
been determined by the Coast and Geodetic Survey,
it is expected that we shall be able to greatly
improve on the elevations at present adopted.”
The Signal Service barometer at Huron, D. T.,
stands at 1,300 feet above mean sea-level—marked
(?) or doubtful. The barometer at St. Paul
is 810.9 feet, at Madison 949.2 feet, at Chicago
660.9 feet, above sea level. The elevation of
these barometers above the ground varies between
thirty and seventy-five feet. As to your
other question you are mistaken; Huron still appears
in the “Weather Reports” printed in The

<p class="center no-indent">THE SOUTH AND PROTECTIVE TARIFF.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Jonesboro</span>, Ark.<br>
</p>

<p>How is the South, and, particularly, how are Southern
farmers, benefited by the tariff?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">S. W. Morehead.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Just as other American farmers are.
First, by escaping direct taxation for the support
of the General Government, a form of taxation
that always bears on farmers and the other industrial
classes heavily, as illustrated in direct
taxation for State and county purposes. The
Southern politicians who framed the Constitution
of the Southern Confederacy, a majority of them,
ignored the protectionist policy of Washington,
Madison, Clay, Lowndes, Bell, and other Southern
statesmen of different political parties, and, as
Jefferson Davis puts it, in his “Rise and Fall of
the Confederacy,” “protective duties for the benefit
of special branches of industry were altogether
prohibited.” A tariff for revenue
only, export duties, and direct taxation
were relied on to supply the exchequer
of the Confederacy. What does Mr. Davis say
of the result as regards the last of these sources?
On page 495 of Volume I. he writes: “Within six
months after the passage of the war tax of Aug.
19, 1861, the popular aversion to internal taxation
by the General Government had so influenced
the legislation of the several States that
only in South Carolina, Mississippi, and Texas
were the taxes actually collected from the people.
The quotas of the remaining States had been
raised by the issue of bonds and State Treasury
notes. The public debt of the country was thus
actually increased instead of being diminished
by the taxation imposed by Congress.” Where
did most of the money come from that was
raised by the Confederacy? Off the agricultural
products of the South. As to the foreign loan,
Davis says: “Each bond, at the option of the
holder, was convertible at its nominal amount
into cotton at the rate of sixpence sterling
for each pound of cotton—say 4,000
pounds of cotton for each bond of a
hundred pounds sterling.” The farmer was paid
for the cotton in Confederate currency or bonds,
as a rule, and any other cotton exported from the
country was compelled to pay an export duty to
help pay the interest on the foreign bonds. But
not only does the policy of American protection
tend to keep the amount raised by direct taxation
down to a minimum (as now, when, except the
internal revenue tax on whisky and tobacco,
nearly the entire revenue of the Federal Government
is collected off of imports), but it
levies the tariff mainly on such articles
as can be produced in this country,
so compelling consumers of Southern cotton, sugar,
rice, tobacco, etc., to pay better prices for
these articles, or foreign competitors to reduce
their profits when selling to American consumers;
while it admits, coffee, tea, and other home
necessities that we cannot produce, free of duty.
It lays a duty on iron and other ores, and so encourages
the Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama
miner to delve for the wealth beneath his feet. It
taxes cotton goods, and so holds out an extra inducement
over all that nature has done to encourage
the South to erect cotton factories. The same
is true in a thousand other lines of manufacture.
In general, it attracts capital into the South to engage
in mining and manufacturing; it keeps
money at home; it builds up home markets; it
develops natural resources; it quickens
the inventive genius of the nation,
and it diversifies industries, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
so provides occupations adapted to the various
talents of different persons. This last is what
the South needs more, in proportion, than any
other section of the Union. Diversity of occupation,
like diversity of crops, is essential to the
realization of the best results. In many cases
the most expert mechanics would make inferior
farmers. The girl who “loves dearly to attend
cotton-looms” (as a female operative in the weaving
department of the Southern Exposition at
Louisville lately exclaimed) would not stay on a
farm. Diversity of industry affords opportunity
for every worker to make the most of his
abilities. It is the safety-valve of labor, which
prevents any one occupation from being overgorged
with laborers. It is the great equalizer of
wages. The South is only beginning to realize
the importance of home manufactures.
Georgia is alive to this matter; so
are some portions of Kentucky. Other Southern
States are awakening to it. If it be true that in
some parts of the North the manufacturers are
strong enough to stand without protection, it is
not yet true of the same industries in the South,
and the latter should demand that the tariff be
maintained until she has acquired like strength.
She has the cotton, iron, sugar, cheaper labor,
and on account of the climate it costs the laborers
less to live there than in the North. Why
should she not rival France, of similar climate,
in manufactures? Capitalists are asking “why
not;” and capital is pouring into the South faster
than ever before. It would be suicidal to drive
this capital back. The South will be stupid if
she exerts herself to keep her children shut up to
agricultural pursuits and continues to spend
more than half the value of her surplus products
in sending them to market and bringing them
back in a manufactured condition (as she always
has done) instead of manufacturing them at
home.</p>

<p>Who was the author of the touching poem commencing,
“I am dying, Egypt, dying?” It is said that
he was an army officer.</p>

<p class="right">
J. H.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It was William Haines Lytle, who
was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1826. He belonged
to a cluster of brilliant young writers
whose early ambition was to build up a school of
Western literature, but who were drawn into the
whirl of more active life, which left little time for
courting the muses. On the breaking out of the
late war he went into the army, serving as a
Colonel in Western Virginia in 1861. He was
wounded at Perryville, Ky., in October, 1862,
was promoted for gallant services, and, finally,
was killed at the battle of Chickamauga, Sept.
20, 1863. He was greatly beloved by his fellow
officers for his noble social qualities as well as for
his martial bearing; and nothing could be more
unjust, according to the testimony of those who
knew him well, than the story recently started by
a flippant penny-a-liner, that he wrote
the poem above referred to, properly entitled
“The Death of Mark Antony,” on the walls of a
guard-house in St. Louis, in which he was held
under arrest over night for disorderly conduct on
his way home from the theater, where he had
seen Booth in Shakespeare’s great drama of
“Antony and Cleopatra.” That the poem was
suggested to him by witnessing Booth’s representation
of this play is probably true: and it is
asserted by some that he had written it, in part at
least, some time before the eve of his death, but
the following version of the peculiar circumstances
under which this greatly admired lyric
was completed and transmitted to the world corresponds
with the traditions of the army, and is
probably true. John M. Balthes, of Clifton, Ill.,
who was once a fellow-townsman of General
Lytle, at Zanesville, Ohio, writing to a fellow-soldier
of that gallant officer, says:</p>

<p>“I send you the following beautiful lines, written
by him in the middle of the night, just before the
next day’s battle, in which he lost his life. The
General being strongly impressed, or having a
premonition that he should lose his life in the
battle that was so soon to open, sat absorbed and
alone in his tent, when an officer coming in admonished
him that he needed rest before the
serious business planned for the next day.
Thereupon General Lytle handed him these
verses, remarking that they would be the last he
should ever write.” This poem was published in
<span class="smcap">The Sunday Inter Ocean</span> of Oct. 7, almost precisely
as given by Mr. Balthes, and as it appears
in “Famous Single and Fugitive Poems,” by Rossiter
Johnson.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Farmer’s Wife.</span><br>
</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—They seem to thrive well, and they
produce fine-looking cocoons; but as to the value
of these latter compared with those produced
from mulberry leaves, it is not yet time to speak
positively. The strength, fineness, and other elements
of value have not been fully tested and
pronounced upon by experts. Miss Nellie
Lincoln Rossiter, of Philadelphia, who has
written a little hand-book on the raising of silk-worms,
says that there is no <em>apparent</em> difference
between the silk crops from morette, a species of
white mulberry, and Osage orange leaves. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
would be well for persons interested in this question
to correspond with the Woman’s National
Silk Association of Philadelphia. An interesting
experiment in raising silk-worms has been successfully
carried on the past season by the Misses
Sarah Dewey and Alice Coykendall, at Canton,
Ill. They procured the eggs from Philadelphia,
with instructions for the management of them,
and an exchange says: “They now have 3,500
worms in all stages of development, from those
just hatched to those which have their cocoons
fully formed. They are kept in an upstairs room

<p>Give some of the facts as to the origin and acts of

Union as “American Knights,” “Sons of Liberty,” etc.;
and of the trial of Dodd for conspiring against the
government.</p>

<p class="right">

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The treasonable organization known
during the late war, at one time as
the “Mutual Protection Society,” again as the
“Circle of Honor,” or the “Circle,” or “Knights of
the Mighty Host,” but more widely as “Knights of
the Golden Circle,” first developed itself
in the West in 1862, about the time
of the first conscription, or draft
of troops, which it was designed to obstruct
and resist. An association under the last of these
names had existed for some years at the South
being one of the chief means used to foment the
rebellion before the outbreak. Because of some
exposures of the signs, rituals, etc., of the
Knights of the Golden Circle, Sterling Price, the
Confederate general, had instituted as its
successor in Missouri a secret political order,
known as the “Corps de Belgique,”
in honor of his chief coadjutor, Charles L. Hunt
then Belgian Consul at St. Louis. Its special object
was to beat up recruits for Price and otherwise
co-operate with him in his design of overrunning
Missouri. This was afterward merged
into another secret order, called the “Order of
American Knights,” commonly known as the
“O. A. K.,” organized in the autumn of 1863 by
Clement L. Vallandigham, of Ohio, and P. C.
Wright, of New York. It is believed that it was
founded by Vallandigham in consultation with
Jefferson Davis and other arch-rebels at Richmond,
during his banishment within the rebel
lines. At least, members of the order in Indiana
boasted that the ritual was prepared by Davis
himself, and Mary Ann Pitman, at one time attached
to General Forrest’s command as a rebel
spy, declared that Davis was a member of the
order. In Indiana, in May, 1864, owing to the
names of some of the leaders and the signs and
passwords of the order having got into the possession
of the Federal authorities, its name was
finally changed to the “Order of the Sons of
Liberty,” or “Knights of the Order of the Sons
of Liberty,” and a ritual was instituted. These
soon became general. Local branches of the organization
used other names outside their lodges,
such as “Peace Organization” in Illinois, “Star
Organization” in Kentucky, “American Organization”
in Missouri, “McClellan Minute Men” in
New York, “Democratic Invincible Club” in Chicago,
“Democratic Reading-room” in Louisville,
and so on.</p>

<p>This order had a Supreme Council for
the United States at large, of which the chief
officers were a Supreme Commander, a Secretary
and a Treasurer. There was a Grand Council
for each State, whose chief officers were a Grand
Commander, a Deputy Grand Commander, a
Grand Secretary, and a Grand Treasurer, and a
certain number of Major Generals, one for each
of its “military districts.” There was also a
“Parent Temple” in each county and subordinate
temples in townships. The constitution of the
order declared that “the Supreme Commander
shall be Commander-in-chief of all military
forces belonging to the order in the various
States, when called into actual service.” There
were four Major Generals in Indiana, each commanding
“a military district and its army.” In
Illinois, where its organization was at one time
very complete, the members in each Congressional
district constituted a brigade, under a
“Brigadier General.” Those of each county a “regiment,”
commanded by a “Colonel,” and those
of each township a “company.” In Indiana companies
were subdivided into “squads.” The McClellan
Minute Men of New York were similarly
organized.</p>

<p>The first Supreme Commander was P. C.
Wright, editor of the New York <cite>News</cite>, who was
subsequently incarcerated in Fort Lafayette,
New York harbor, when he was succeeded by
Vallandigham. Robert Holloway, of Illinois, is
said to have acted as Supreme Commander in the
latter’s absence in Canada. Charles L. Hunt,
Grand Commander for Missouri, Charles
E. Dunn, Deputy Grand Commander,
and Green B. Smith, Secretary, being
placed under arrest, divulged facts confirmatory
of the above. H. H. Dodd, the
Grand Commander for Indiana, was arrested
and tried at Indianapolis before a military
commission “for conspiring against the government,”
“violations of the laws of war,” and other
charges. He was finally turned over to the civil
authorities and liberated.</p>

<p>Vallandigham declared in a speech at Dayton,
Ohio, in the summer of 1863, that the order numbered
500,000 men; others claimed 800,000, and
some still more. Statements of its officers at
different times, represented its numbers in Indiana
as 75,000 to 125,000; in Illinois as 100,000
to 140,000; in Ohio as 80,000 to 108,000; in
Michigan and New York as about 20,000 each,
and so on. In March, 1864, it was represented
that the total force capable of being mobilized
for effective service was 340,000. Green B.
Smith and other witnesses testified to having
purchased and shipped arms to various points to
arm the order. Another witness, once a member
of the order in Indiana, testified that there were
6,000 muskets and 60,000 revolvers, besides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
private arms in possession of the order in that
State.</p>

<p>The members were bound by the most rigorous
oaths. Its “declaration of principles” declared
that it was the imperative duty of its members
to resist the functionaries of the Federal
Government, “and, if need be, expel
them by force of arms.” The witnesses,
former members, testified that the
duties of members were: 1. To aid soldiers to
desert and harbor and protect them. 2. To discourage
enlistments and resist the draft. 3. To
circulate disloyal and treasonable publications.
4. To communicate and give assistance to the
enemy. 5. To recruit for the Confederate army.
6. To furnish the rebels with arms and ammunition.
7. To co-operate with the enemy in raids and
invasions. 8. To harass loyal men and destroy
their property when so ordered to do. 9. To assassinate
officers of the government when so
directed to do. 10. To establish a Northwestern
Confederacy.</p>

<p>The above statements are compiled
from the reports of the Hon. J. Holt, Judge Advocate
General, to Secretary Stanton on “Secret
Societies,” and other State papers. Unusual
space has been given to this question because it
has been asked repeatedly, and our attention is
called to the fact that it is not treated in the popular
cyclopedias and histories.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The formula for making Spaulding’s
prepared glue is not available. The following
(Dumoulin’s) is quite as good: Take soft water,
1 quart; best pale glue, 2 pounds; dissolve in a
covered vessel by the heat of a water bath or in a
vessel immersed in boiling water; cool, and add,
gradually, of nitric acid (specific gravity 1.335) 7
ounces; when cold put it into bottles. It is very
strong and does not gelatinize.</p>

<p>The following formula, known as “Chinese
cement,” produces a cement for porcelain, glass,
fancy work, jewelry, etc., so strong that wood or
porcelain can be joined together so firmly that
they will break anywhere else rather than where
cemented: Take of finest pale orange shell-lac
(broken small) 4 ounces; strongest rectified
spirits 3 ounces, and digest them together in a
corked bottle in a warm place until dissolved.
It should have about the consistence of molasses.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The “Man of Ross” is a title given to
John Kyrle, of Ross parish, Hereford County,
Eng., because of his remarkable spirit of enterprise
and great benevolence. Although only an
untitled, private gentleman of moderate fortune,
he did far more for the good of his community
than many a wealthy lord of the manor. Pope
appreciated the true nobility of Kyrle, and has
done full honor to him in the third epistle of his
“Moral Essays,” “On the Use of Riches.” Coleridge,
too, has paid a beautiful tribute to his
memory in the lines:</p>

<p>Seeing an Inquirer, in the Curiosity Shop, asks
information in regard to Arkansas, I will say that
the Eastern Central portion of the State is nearly
level, and very fertile. All fruits, vegetables,
cereals, tobacco, cotton, sorghum, sweet potatoes—in
fact anything one may plant—gives large returns.
Owing to this locality lying in the great
cotton belt, and to the large quantities of cotton
produced, the usual price per bushel of Indian
corn is $1; oats, 90c, and oats will yield
from forty to sixty bushels per acre, with the
rude implements and tillage here in vogue—a
one-horse cast-iron plow, and a small tree top for
a harrow. After oats and wheat are harvested
the same land is frequently planted in corn, or
sown with millet, or Hungarian grass, thus producing
two crops a year. Land here is cheap,
water is soft and pure, and timber abundant.
The rivers abound in fish, and the immense forests
in game. I came from Indiana. I have lived
here twelve years. Have never seen a case of
consumption in the State.</p>

to polish sea-shells and prepare them for sale.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—According to Cooley, one of the highest
authorities on processes employed in the arts
and manufactures, the surfaces of certain shells
which have a natural polish should be first
cleansed by rubbing with a rag dipped in hydrochloric
acid (obtainable at any drug store) till the
dull outer skin is removed. They must then be
promptly washed in warm water, dried in hot
sawdust, and polished with chamois
leather. But shells destitute of natural polish
may be either varnished or rubbed with a
mixture of tripoli powder and turpentine, applied
by means of a “wash-leather” (split sheepskin
dressed with oil), and afterward with fine tripoli
alone, and finally a little olive oil, the surface being
brought up with vigorous use of the chamois
leather. But there are shells which must first be
boiled in a strong solution of potash, then ground
on wheels, sometimes all the way through the
outer stratum, to show an underlying one, after
which they are polished with hydrochloric acid
and putty powder. This last process better be
left to men who make a business of shell-grinding;
for it is said that “shell-grinders are almost
all cripples in their hands,” owing to the dangerous
nature of this operation.</p>

<p>This comparison sheds very uncertain light
upon the question as to the effect of compulsory
attendance laws, because the school age period
is different in different States, and it does not
show the number of pupils in private schools.
It would be far more interesting in this connection
if it included only all children of the ages
within the compulsory period in each State, and
gave the number of such children enrolled in
schools of any sort before and after the passage
of the law. Nevertheless, these tables do indicate
plainly enough that such laws are not
strictly enforced in any State, and are, comparatively
speaking, a dead letter in others.</p>

and then opens out in the last six or seven inches
to about the same diameter as in front of the

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">C. G. Boone.</span><br>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—A night glass is simply a small terrestrial
telescope, or spy-glass, ordinarily in the
form of a large opera-glass, with an unusually
large lens in the end toward the object to be
viewed, called the object-glass, which serves to
concentrate a large amount of light, and so render
objects seen at night much more distinct
than when viewed by either the naked eye or an
ordinary spy-glass. Since it is a principle in optics
that “it is impossible, by any optical arrangement
whatever, to obtain an image whose brightest
part shall surpass the brightest part of the
object,” it is obvious that nothing seen through a
night-glass, even in the clearest night, can appear
as distinct as in daylight.</p>

ornamental articles can be cut from the finest
quality of this stone; but generally such articles

than appeared in Our Curiosity Shop of Aug. 16?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The date here called in question is
the one given for this feat in Clemens Petersen’s
article on Niagara in “Johnson’s New Universal
Cyclopedia,” but in <span class="smcap">The Daily Inter Ocean</span> of
Sept. 1 we gave an account from the lips of DeWitt
C. McMurtry, now of Philadelphia, who
claims to be the only survivor of that perilous
passage. He says the trip was made June 29
1859. He gives the dimensions of the stanch
little steamer at “about 150 feet over all and 16
feet beam.” She was a side-wheeler, with new
and powerful engines, usually carrying 125 or
130 pounds pressure of steam, but set at this
time to blow off at 228 pounds. The run was
made to evade the payment of a mortgage held
by Judge Addington, of Buffalo, and under an offer
from some Toronto parties to pay $25,000
for the Maid of the Mist if delivered at
Queenstown, on the Canada side, at the mouth of
the river. Joel Robinson, the captain, was
offered $500, the engineer, a Mr. Jones, and the
fireman, Mr. McMurtry, each $100, to undertake
this task. The captain had himself lashed in the
wheelhouse, and the other two were shut in below
under battened hatches. The distance from the
last landing above the whirlpool to Queenstown
is just five miles, one mile of which is
through the whirlpool-torrent. This distance
was made in seven and three-quarter minutes,
only two of which were spent in the rapids. The
boat was dashed about at a terrible rate. “When
she first struck the rapids,” says McMurtry, “our
boat leaped downward perhaps thirty feet. Then
she was hurled clear out of the water. Down
she would go, as if she would never stop, when
suddenly she would right herself and, with
a bound which seemed almost human, leap out of
the water. The current runs forty-five miles an
hour and the waves are twenty feet high. Jones
and I were almost killed by the quickly succeeding
shocks. I felt my strength rapidly oozing
away as I clung to the hand-rails for dear life.
There was barely time to catch my breath between
concussions. Suddenly the current struck
her sideways, she swung around, and shot down
the stream. We had escaped the whirlpool. When
I got out at Queenstown the water was waist
high, the boat had been so racked and wrenched

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It was New Jersey; which organized
as an independent State two days before the
declaration of independence, with a constitution
that allowed universal suffrage, male and female,
without regard to color. This constitution was
not altered until 1844, when, among other
changes, the suffrage was restricted to males;
largely because of the apathy shown by women,
especially those of the better class, in regard to
the exercise of the ballot.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The number of Union soldiers captured

soldiers who died while prisoners was 29,725,
or little more than one in seven of all captured.
The number of Confederates who died while
prisoners was 26,774, or very nearly one in eighteen.
The total number of graves in the National
cemeteries is 315,555, only 172,409 of which

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The battle of Solferino was fought in
1859 between the French, under the Emperor
Louis Napoleon, and the Sardinians, under Victor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
Emanuel on the side of the victors, and the
Austrians, the oppressors of Italy, led by the Emperor
Francis Joseph. Solferino is a place of no
importance in itself, being but a village of some
1,400 inhabitants, situated in the province of
Brescia, North Italy. Its position, with its
famous tower, called the “Spy of Italy,” because
it commands a view of the whole broad plain of
Lombardy, gives it great strategic importance;
and in this war, which was, in fact, for the independence
and unity of Italy, the battle of Magenta,
twenty days earlier, in which the Austrians
were driven from the field with a loss of 9,713
killed and about 11,000 wounded and missing,
and this decisive victory at Solferino, in which
the allies lost about 18,000 killed and wounded
and the Austrians 20,000, besides 6,000 prisoners
and 30 cannon, resulted in the treaty of Villafranca,
ceding Lombardy to Sardinia and virtually
terminating Austrian interference in Italian
affairs; so paving the way to the ultimate unification
of Italy, which quickly followed.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—We first read of a Democratic party
in 1807, with such men as Thomas Jefferson and
James Madison for its leaders. It is sometimes
referred to by historians as the “Democratic Republican”
party, and its adherents were quite as
frequently termed Republicans as Democrats.
Not until the first Democratic convention, in
1832, did what is now generally understood as
the simon pure Democratic party assume positive
shape. Thence forward it rapidly developed into
the defender of slavery; the opponent of National
banks and protective tariff; the advocate
and administrator of the doctrine, “To the victors
belong the spoils,” or rotation in office; first
vigorously espoused and put into practice by
General Jackson; and finally the champion of
State sovereignty and apologist and abettor of
secession. For a synopsis of the present political
salmagundi, or olla podrida, denominated
Democracy, and for the doctrines of the Republican
party see Our Curiosity Shop for 1882,

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Junction City</span>, Kan.<br>

<p>Please give us a sketch of Will Carleton, author of
“Farm Ballads,” and other poems.</p>

<span class="smcap">Lady Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Will Carleton was born in Hudson,
Mich., Oct. 21, 1845. His parents, John H. and
Celeste E. Carleton, were of English descent.
They removed to Michigan from the East at an
early day, where the father cleared the farm upon
which he afterward lived for forty years. He was
a man of great natural force of character, with a
talent for extemporaneous speaking, and he soon
became a man of influence, filling many offices of
trust in the community, and contributing powerfully
to the rapid success of the Methodist Church
in Southern Michigan, of which he was a devoted
member. He died in 1872. The mother is still
living and resides with her son in Brooklyn, N.
Y. She is a woman of decided force of character
and sweetness of heart, and is beloved by all who
know her. Her only other son having died on his
way home, after a long imprisonment in the South
during the late war, and her daughters being
dead, the subject of this sketch is the only one of
her five children now surviving. The boyhood
of Will Carleton was passed in farm labor
and study. At the district school he was particularly
fond of grammar, and manifested a spirit
of criticism that at times got him into discussions
with his teachers which disturbed their serenity
of temper. Frequently when the day for
“speaking pieces” came around he would surprise
his fellow pupils with original bits of humor,
which, although intended for good-natured
satires, ended more than once in schoolboy
fights. Later he walked five miles daily to attend
high school in town. At 16 he taught a country
school of fifty-two pupils, and any allusions he
makes to “boarding ’round” are born of experience.
He graduated at Hillsdale College in 1869
with the degree of A. B., and for two years devoted
himself to editorial work, being during the
last of the two editor of the Detroit <cite>Weekly
Tribune</cite>. He then returned to Hillsdale to reside,
while giving more time to preparations for
a literary life, and occasionally filling lecturing
and reading engagements.</p>

<p>What may properly be called Mr. Carleton’s
first literary success was a political satire entitled
“Fax,” written during his junior vacation
in the summer of 1868, at Aurora, Ill., and
delivered before literary clubs during the political
campaign of that year. Several thousand
copies of it were published and widely
circulated. His graduation poem, at
Hillsdale, the next summer, was entitled “Rifts in
the Clouds;” afterward incorporated in “Farm
Legends.” Among his other early poems is one
read on Decoration Day, 1870, entitled “Cover
Them Over,” which was copied extensively at the
time, and has since been recited on many other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
such occasions. The poems which first brought
him into general notice throughout the country
and abroad were his “Farm Ballads,” which having
first, many of them, appeared in <cite>Harpers’
Weekly</cite> and other periodicals, were published by
Harper &amp; Bros., in 1873. “Farm Legends” followed,
in 1875; “Young Folks’ Centennial
Rhymes,” in 1876, and “Farm Festivals,” in 1881.
In 1878 he visited Europe, spending much time
among the peasantry of England, Ireland, and
Scotland, and visiting the continent. The same
year he removed to Chicago, making that the center
of a large lecturing circuit, covering most of
the Western States. Wherever he went large audiences
received him with cordial welcome and
tokens of approbation. In 1880 he removed to
Boston, and in 1882 to Brooklyn, N. Y., his present
home, near the center of the Eastern lecture
circuit. Mr. Carleton contributes to several periodicals,
lectures from two to five evenings a week,
and is meanwhile preparing another book for the
press, which will appear soon. His former volumes
have sold to the extent of over 200,000
copies, and the demand is well maintained.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">St. Lawrence</span>, Dak.<br>
</p>

<p>1. What is necessary to constitute “continuous residence”
on a pre-emption claim? 2. What more does
the law require of a single man to “prove up” than of
the head or a family?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—1. The courts have repeatedly decided
that “the sufficiency of residence and improvement
is a question of fact to be decided
from the circumstances of each case.” In the
case of <em>Copley</em> versus <em>Rell</em> it was ruled that
“where, from the nature of the land entered under
the pre-emption law, it would appear that the
claimant has selected it for speculative purposes
rather than for purposes of improvement and
cultivation, the evidences of good faith and
<em>occupation</em> should be of the most satisfactory
character.” And again, in the case of <em>Porter</em>
versus <em>Johnson</em>, it was held that what constitutes
residence within the meaning of the law
“is simply a question of good faith, and
each case must be considered upon its
own merits.” In the case of <em>Boyse</em> versus <em>Goss</em>,
it was held that “the statute requires inhabitancy
on the land pre-empted and this means actual residence
or a home.” In case of <em>Southern Pacific
Railroad</em> versus <em>Newton</em>, it was held that “occupation
and use of land for purposes other than
cultivation, etc., do not constitute a pre-emption
claim.” While the above rulings distinctly reveal
the intent of the government to exact all that is
essential to actual settlement and the maintenance
of a home upon the land, there are other
rulings which indicate that the law will be construed
liberally so long as the above essentials
are preserved. For example, it has been decided
that “a party while having an actual residence on
his claims, may work elsewhere for other people a
few weeks at a time.” Again, “where a party is very
poor, a dug-out in the side of a hill or a sod-house
is a satisfactory residence, and four
pre-emptors may combine to erect and
occupy a house on the corner common
to their claims, provided each pre-emptor
resides in his own part of the house. Should one
of them be unmarried he may board in the family
of a married pre-emptor.” 2. The law makes no
difference between married and unmarried pre-emptors.
In construing it, as regards what constitutes
residence, the last ruling above quoted
indicates that the government is disposed to
make some allowance for the unfortunate circumstances
of a young man who has not found any
girl willing to share his dug-out sod-house or
tepee and cook his corn-dodgers and potatoes for
the privileges of wifehood, including a dower interest
in the estate. Married and unmarried pre-emptors
must each make a final affidavit, declaring
that they have complied with the law in every
particular, are not disqualified by owning 320
acres of land elsewhere in any State or Territory
of the United States, or by other reasons specified,
and must file pre-emptor’s proofs in the form of
sworn answers to questions furnished them on
printed blanks, which must be accompanied by
sworn testimony of two witnesses, taken separately,
in the form of answers to questions stated
in another set of printed blanks prepared by the
Commissioner of the General Land Office, all designed
to attest that the law as to continuous
residence, cultivation, etc., has been complied
with in good faith.</p>

<p>Who was the young man who when walking on the
brink of Niagara River, some years ago, in company
with his intended bride and her little sister, accidentally
tossed the latter into the rapids, and perished in
the effort to save her? What was the child’s name, and
how did it all happen?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">James.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It is related of a Mr. Addington, a
son of Judge Addington, of Buffalo, that when
standing on Luna Island, just above the Falls of
Niagara, with a Miss De Forrest and her little
sister, he seized the latter playfully, and, holding
her over the brink, threatened to toss her into the
river. The child, in a spasm of terror, sprang
from his arms and fell into the edge of the fatal
current. Instantly young Addington bounded
after her, succeeded in seizing her, and caught a
frail bush for support. Had this held they might
both have been saved, but it gave way, and man
and child were carried over the falls. The common
traditions represent that Mr. Addington and
Miss De Forrest, who was a very lovely young
lady, were engaged to be married, and that in
consequence of the terrible fate of her lover and
sister she became insane. This was in 1844, or
thereabouts.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To settle a dispute, please give a description of the
tarantula, and tell where it is found.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There are several varieties of tarantulas.
The one from which they all take this
name, the “lycosa tarantula,” is the largest of
European spiders, named from Taranto, Italy,
where they are very numerous. Its body is
from one and a half to two inches long, ashy
brown above, thorax marked with gray and abdomen
with three-cornered spots and curved
streaks bordered with white, with a patch of saffron-color
below all, crossed by a black band. It
has one spiracle, or breathing aperture, on each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
side, one pulmonary sac, and eight eyes. It does
not spin a web to snare its prey, but captures it
by running it down, and it lives in holes lined
with a silk-like substance. Its bite is no more
severe than that of some kinds of wasps, and is
certainly not nearly so dangerous to life as it is
fabled to be. The notion that its bite produced a
sort of delirium and was curable only by dancing
to lively music until the sufferer fell from
sheer exhaustion was a superstition. For
a good illustration of this ugly insect see
the cut accompanying the word “tarantula” in
Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary.</p>

<p>There is a variety of tarantula in our Southern
States, called “lycosa Carolinensis” by naturalists,
which is even larger than its European
namesake, being about two inches long, and having
legs spreading at least four inches. It has
whitish legs, white sides, whitish dots and lines
on the belly, and is of a mouse color on top and
black or dark colored underneath. Like the Italian
tarantula, it spins no web, takes its prey by
pursuit, and lives in holes lined with a sort of
silk. It is peculiar in carrying its young on its
back, and it seldom bites.</p>

<p>There are certain spiders of the genus mygale
in the Southwestern States, which are sometimes
improperly called tarantulas.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—A correspondent, the Rev. W. P.

<p class="right">
O. T. K.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Articles of Confederation conferred
upon Congress none but delegated powers
and recognized the absolute sovereignty of the
States. Aside from the right to make war and
peace, regulate foreign intercourse, receive and
send embassadors, control the coinage of money,
and settle disputed boundaries, Congress had no
power to act without the consent of nine of the
States, each casting one ballot. It could not levy
taxes, and before 1787 the war debt had destroyed
the financial reputation of the United States
abroad. The States were divided in their interests,
and at the last Colonial Congress but eight of
the States sent delegates. Not the least of the
weaknesses of the confederation was the non-provision
for a chief magistrate, or for a national
judiciary. To meet these needs it was found necessary
to frame a new constitution, systematically
organizing a permanent form of government.
This document arranges the powers of government
under three heads—legislative, executive,
and judicial—and places the supreme power in
the people of the whole country, instead of vainly
endeavoring to maintain a multitude of independent
States. It replaced a disjointed confederacy
of jealous States with a Nation.</p>

what is the rank and pay?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Constant Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—A chaplain in the navy cannot be less
than 21 nor more than 35 years of age at the time
of his appointment. Limits of age of new appointees
in the army are not specified in the statute.
The President may retire a chaplain unconditionally
after forty years’ service, or after he is
62 years of age. The President is authorized, by
and with the consent of the Senate, to appoint
thirty post chaplains and a chaplain for each of
the cavalry and two infantry regiments of colored
troops in the army, and not to exceed twenty-four
chaplains in the navy. The rank and pay of
chaplains in the navy are stated on page 88 of
Curiosity Shop for 1882. Chaplains in the army
have the rank of captain of infantry, without
command, and are on the same footing with other
officers of the army as to terms of office, retirement,
and pensions. The pay of an army chaplain
is $1,500 a year for the first five years’ service,
$1,650 for the next five years, $1,800 for the
next five, $1,950 for the next five, and $2,100
after twenty years’ service. It should be borne in
mind that the duty of chaplains of colored troops
and of post chaplains includes instruction of the
enlisted men in the common English branches of
education.</p>

<p>1. When were the salaries of postmasters changed
from a percentage on stamps sold to a percentage on
stamps canceled? 2. What is the postage on newspapers
to Great Britain? 3. Can a supplement be sent
without extra charge?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Subscriber.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—1. Under the postal law approved
Jan. 23, 1874, the compensation of postmasters
of the first, second, and third classes consisted of
annual salaries, assigned in even hundreds of
dollars, to be ascertained and fixed by the Postmaster
General from their respective quarterly
returns for four quarters immediately preceding
the adjustment or readjustment, by adding to the
whole amount of box rents, not exceeding $2,000
per annum, commissions, also not to exceed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
$2,000 per annum, on the postal revenues of the
office. All postmasters whose salaries, computed
by this law, did not amount to $1,000, constituted
a fourth class, whose compensation was the
box rents collected at their offices and commissions
on other postal revenues of their offices at
the rate of 60 per cent on the first $100 or less
per quarter, 50 per cent on the next $300
or less, and 40 per cent on the excess
above $400 per quarter. To swell the
revenues of their offices, postmasters of the
fourth-class, and some of those of the third and
second-classes, went into the large cities and sold
stamps to mercantile firms and other heavy dealers,
in some cases even sharing commissions
with them. This abuse led to a revision of the
law in the act of June 17, 1878, so that commissions
should be allowed only “on stamps canceled
as postages on matter actually mailed” at
the offices in question. 2. The postage on newspapers
to Great Britain and most of her colonies,
the world over, is 1 cent for every two ounces or
fraction thereof. Better inquire at postoffice for
postal rates, or consult the United States Postal
Guide, which can be seen at every postoffice. 3.
That depends on the weight.</p>

it was, and is, a saying in the West, “All

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—No one work contains a full account
of all the toils and sufferings, the thrilling scenes
and exciting experiences of arctic exploration.
The books and charts on this subject would make
a good-sized library. As respects the northeast
passage, they include narratives of the expeditions
of Willoughby and Chancellor (English,
1553), Burroughs (English, 1556), Pet and Jackman
(English, 1580), William Barentz (Dutch,
1594-96), Henry Hudson (English, 1608, and
Dutch, 1609), Wood (Dutch, 1676). Behring
(Russian, 1741), Shalaroff (Russian), who with
his crew perished of starvation, Wiggans
(English, 1784), Billings (Russian, 1787), and
finally, Professor Adolf Eric Nordenskjold
(Swedish), who, after two other expeditions
(severally in 1875 and 1876), in 1878-9 succeeded
in sailing from the North Atlantic eastward,
through the Arctic Ocean and Behring
Straits, into the Pacific, thus triumphantly completing
the discovery of the “northeast passage.”</p>

<p>The search for the “northwest passage” has
engaged nearly two hundred and fifty expeditions,
of various nationalities. It would be useless
to enumerate them all. The first attempts
were made by Sebastian Cabot (English, 1498),
and Martin Frobisher (English, 1576); Captain
John Davis, after whom Davis’ Strait is named
(English, 1585-88); Henry Hudson, after whom
Hudson’s Bay is named (English, 1610); Button
(English, 1615), and Bylot and Baffin, after the
latter of whom Baffin’s Bay takes its name
(English, 1615-16). Little more in the way of
discovery in this direction was realized, although
occasional attempts were made by Jens Munk, a
Danish navigator, Fox, James, and others, until
1818, when Ross and Parry, under direction and
support of the British Admiralty, entered upon a
series of expeditions extending over more than a
decade, by which a large addition was made to
the knowledge of the geography of this region as
far west as long 110 deg west, in Melville Sound,
and north to latitude 82 deg. 45 min., and the
magnetic pole was discovered. Dease, Simpson,
Dr. John Rae, and other explorers followed. Then
in 1845, came the memorable expedition of Sir
John Franklin, whose party perished to the last
man, but not until they had left records, since
recovered, of discoveries showing that Sir John,
had he been spared to return, was prepared to
claim the honor of discovering the northwest
passage. But as these records were not discovered
by McClintock’s expedition (English) until

the discovery of Franz Joseph Land; the British

in the melancholy death of Captain De Long and
so many of his companions by starvation.

<p><em>Answer.</em>—That enthusiastic little rebel, Rhode
Island, was the first of the colonies to declare itself
“free from all dependence on the crown of
Great Britain.” This she did on May 4, 1776.
The Assembly of Virginia in the same month instructed
her delegates to the Continental Congress
to present to that body a proposition “affirming
the independence of the colonies from Great
Britain.” In compliance with these instructions
Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, on June 7, 1776,
introduced his famous resolutions: “That these
united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free
and independent States; that they are absolved
from all allegiance to the British crown;
and that all political connection between
them and the State of Great Britain is, and
ought to be, totally dissolved. That it is expedient
forthwith to take the most effectual measures
for forming foreign alliances. That a plan
of confederation be prepared and transmitted to
the respective colonies for their consideration
and approbation.” John Adams seconded these
resolutions, and an animated discussion ensued.
On June 8 a committee, consisting of Thomas
Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin,
Roger Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston, was
appointed to draw up a declaration of independence
embodying the sense of Lee’s resolutions.
On July 2 Lee’s resolutions were passed by the
vote of twelve of the thirteen colonies, the New
York delegates refraining from voting for want
of instructions from their province. On July 3
the formal declaration, almost precisely as
written by Thomas Jefferson, was presented by
the committee above named, and was debated
with great spirit, John Adams being the chief
speaker on the part of the committee. The discussion
was resumed on the morning of the
4th, and at 2 o’clock in the afternoon, after
one or two slight modifications, it was adopted.
The announcement was hailed with the liveliest
enthusiasm. “Ring! ring!” shouted the lad stationed
below to give the signal to the old bellman
in the State House tower; and he did ring
until the whole city shouted for joy. The King’s
arms were wrenched from the Court House and
burned in the streets; bonfires were lighted, the
city illuminated, and the exultation was prolonged
far into the night. In New York City the
populace hurled the leaden statue of George III.
from its pedestal and molded it into bullets, and
in all the great cities similar demonstrations of
enthusiasm were exhibited. Washington had the
declaration read at the head of every brigade of
the army, and the soldiers pledged fealty to the
cause of independence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</p>

<p>Who invented the life-boat, and when did he do it?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">James.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It is not easy to determine this
question. Many writers give the credit to Mr.
Henry Greathead, of Shields, Eng.; others give it
to Lionel Lukin, a coach-builder, of London; others
to William Wouldhave, parish clerk of St.
Hilda’s Church, South Shields, Eng. Now that
the Royal National Life-boat Institution of
Great Britain alone has 271 life-boats in its service,
and more than 900 lives annually, on the
average, are saved, mainly by these boats, when
the life-saving institutions of other countries are
using them with most gratifying results, it is not
strange that the honor of this invention is zealously
contested. The facts seem to be these:
The first patent for a life-boat was granted in
England, in 1785, to Lionel Lukin. It was not
satisfactory for several reasons, but was improved
by Admiral Graves, of the Royal
Navy, and Henry Greathead, a boatbuilder
of Shields. This was improved by George
Palmer, a member of the National
Life-boat Institution, and remained the
favorite boat in the service until 1851, when
in response to the offer by the Duke of Northumberland
of a prize of 100 guineas, about 100
models of improved life-boats were exhibited, and
the prize was awarded to Mr. James Beeching, of
Yarmouth. This boat, improved by Mr. R.
Peake, of the Royal Dockyard, Woolwich, was
adopted by the National Life-boat Institution,
and is still its favorite model. Undoubtedly
Greathead has received more credit for this invention
than any one else. He received the gold
medals of the Society of Arts and the Royal
Humane Society. He received £1,200 from Parliament
in 1802, and a purse of 100 guineas from
Lloyd’s. He obtained patents and honorable
awards in foreign countries and made large sums
by furnishing boats for life-saving service for
Great Britain and other lands. Nevertheless, the
honor of inventing the self-righting life-boat is
strenuously claimed for William Wouldhave, particularly
by his fellow-townsmen and parishioners
of South Shields. The story is that soon after
a wreck, accompanied with a terrible loss
of life, which occurred at Tynemouth
in September, 1789, Mr. Wouldhave noticed
a wooden dish floating on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
surface of a well, which, on being accidentally
struck by his finger, when he was assisting a
woman to raise a skeel of water, turned bottom
upward, and instantly righted itself again. Capsizing
it again several times, he noted that it always
righted itself. He discovered the self-righting
principle then and there, and soon after
made a model life-boat of tin, which he offered to
exhibit to the ship-owners and mariners of
South Shields as a suitable boat for rescuing persons
from wrecks. The affair was greatly talked
about, and a committee consisting of gentlemen
connected with the merchant marine was appointed
to test the model and any
others that might be offered for inspection.
Greathead, the boatbuilder above mentioned,
exhibited a model at this time, and upon testing
the merits of the boats Wouldhave’s proved to be
self-righting and unsinkable by any water it
might ship. Greathead’s model failed in these
respects, though in others it was pronounced a
good sea-boat. Mr. Greathead, however, was
what Mr. Wouldhave was not, a shrewd business
man. He made improvements in his model,
adopting some of the features of Lukin’s patent
above mentioned and some of Wouldhave’s, and
it was not long before he had introduced it into
actual service, not only in Great Britain, but elsewhere.
Hence his name has become famous as
the inventor of the life-boat, while Wouldhave’s
name was known to few but his townsmen as the
actual and original inventor. The first model
made by Wouldhave is now in the Free Library
Museum at South Shields. His tombstone, in St.
Hilda’s Church-yard, bears a life-boat carved on
it, and above the gaselier in the church a model
life-boat is suspended in memory of him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Jonesboro</span>, Ark.<br>
</p>

<p>Explain how “bulls” and “bears” operate to affect
the prices of stocks and provisions.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">S. W. Morehead.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The means used to “bull” and
“bear,” or raise and depress, the prices of stocks,
grain, provisions, etc., are innumerable, varying
with the needs of the times, but influenced much
more by the combinations of capitalists and
brokers. The “bulls” magnify every circumstance
favorable to the appreciation of the stocks
they hold or have agreed to take at a given time,
while those who have contracted to deliver such
stocks, or who for any reason wish to buy, do all
in their power to depreciate them, and are therefore
nicknamed “bears.” Any one who has ever
witnessed a bull and bear fight will not question
the appropriateness of these terms as applied
to the combatants in the exciting wars among
the kings of the stock board. The
bulls struggle to toss the stocks higher; the
bears squeeze and tug to force the prices down.
The former resort to all kinds of expedients to
induce small holders to cling fast to their stocks
instead of putting them on the market. They
persuade them by direct appeals, or by circulating
encouraging reports, that these stocks are
bound to rise rapidly in value; and they often
combine to buy up the stock of the few who persist
in selling, so as to “corner” the market. Not
content with fair means, they sometimes enter
into combinations with one another, and employ
third parties to buy and sell stocks of the same
description on ’Change, in such a way as to create
the impression that there is a greater demand for
them than there really is, when in fact the sales
are never consummated, or merely amount to an
exchange among themselves. Often, when neither
the foreign nor home news was favorable to their
purposes, false reports have been telegraphed
through the country by interested parties, to affect
the stock board. Similar methods are pursued
on boards of trade.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">ORIGIN OF POSTOFFICES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Waukesha</span>, Wis.<br>
</p>

<p>What country first established a postal system for
transmitting the mail? When was postal communication
established in America? Give us a few facts on
this subject.</p>

<p class="right">
J. J. S.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Couriers for carrying royal or government
dispatches are mentioned in histories of
the earliest times. Royal posts existed in Assyria,
Persia, Greece, and Rome. The name postoffice
originated in the posts, or stations, at intervals
along the roads of the Roman Empire,
where couriers were kept in readiness to start on
the instant. But such posts were not used for
transmitting private letters. The first postal
system for commercial and private correspondence
appears to have been established between
the Hanse Towns early in the thirteenth century.
In the reign of the Emperor Maximilian I.,
of Germany, letter posts were established
by the Princes of Thurn and Taxis, connecting
the chief cities of Austria and Lombardy, and
later, 1516, the same princes connected Vienna
and Brussels in the same way. Maximilian’s successor,
Charles V., encouraged still further extension
of this private postal system by repeated
enfeoffments or special franchises, until all the
great commercial centers of his vast empire,
from Vienna to Madrid, from the Adriatic to
the North Sea, and intervening places,
were brought into regular postal communication.
Far back in the twelfth century the University of
Paris, whose students, gathered from all civilized
nations, numbered not long after this over 25,000,
employed foot-runners to carry letters for its
members to all parts of Europe. But not until
1524 was permission granted to the royal French
posts to carry other letters than those for the
government and the nobility. London merchants
established a postal communication
of their own with France and other continental
countries as early as the fifteenth century,
and it is evident that, although the royal post of
England established in the thirteenth century
was intended and long restricted to the transmission
of government dispatches only, it had
gradually become a vehicle for private correspondence.
In 1581 Thomas Randolph was appointed
the “Chief Postmaster” for England,
with authority to establish and supervise post-houses
and regulate the fees charged by postmen,
but apparently without authority to receive and
handle mail matter, which was left largely to
the discretion of the postmen themselves. Not
until the time of James I. of England was a
postmaster for foreign parts appointed, and steps
taken by the government to establish regular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
running posts, going day and night, for the transmission
of letters for the general public. In
1635 such a mail was established to run weekly
between London and Edinburgh, and soon eight
other lines were instituted.</p>

<p>In this country, Massachusetts provided by
legislation for the postal system as early as 1639,
and Virginia in 1657. A monthly post between
Boston and New York was instituted in 1672. In
the beginning, letters arriving in this country
from beyond the seas were delivered on board the
ship. Letters not called for were left by the
captain at a coffee-house near the wharf, where
they were spread on a table or shelf, awaiting
call. Persons calling not only took charge of
their own letters, but of those of acquaintances
in their neighborhood, either delivering them in
person or leaving them at the minister’s or some
magistrate’s office to be inquired for, or announced
in church. These coffee-houses gradually
grew into common use for letters between
cities and the interiors, until regular posts were
instituted. One of the first acts of the Continental
Congress was the establishment of a general
postoffice department, and the appointment
of Benjamin Franklin, who had enjoyed large
experience in the British colonial postal service,
as the first Postmaster General.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">E. L. Easdale.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—France is carrying a larger national
debt than any other nation. It amounted at the
close of the fiscal year 1882 to $4,683,840,000—nearly
a billion dollars more than that of Great
Britain. Besides this, like our own States
and minor political divisions, the departments
and municipalities of France are carrying local
debts amounting in the aggregate to an immense
sum. The debt of Paris in September, 1880, was
2,295,000,000 francs, or about $450,000,000. The
national debt is well distributed among the people,
there being in 1881 as many as 4,617,900
holders, receiving 851,909,901 francs annually for
interest. So long as this interest, or “rente,” is
paid promptly these holders are, for the most
part, content with the government; but should
the latter plunge the country into a costly war,
rendering it necessary to suspend payment of
the interest, and jeopardizing resumption of such
payments, a popular revolution would in all probability
ensue. This enormous national debt will indisputably
prove a source of weakness to the government
and the nation In the event of a foreign
war. The imperial debt of Germany in 1882 was
only $120,197,528. Add to this the debt proper
of Prussia, $493,821,812, and that of the other
constituent states of the empire, $735,608,892,
and the total was $1,349,728,232. The imperial
debt of Austro-Hungary the same year was $1,107,978,118,
which, added to the Austrian debt
proper, $176,914,016, and the Hungarian debt
proper, $400,532,142, made a total of $1,685,424,276.
The public debt of Italy in 1882 was
$2,042,000,000; of Spain, $1,826,613,093; of
Great Britain, $3,814,500,000; of Russia, $4,314,607,500;
of the United States, $1,918,312,294.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the industrial condition of
France is better than that of any other European
country, except Great Britain, Belgium, and Holland.
The French people have been accumulating
wealth at a remarkable rate since the Franco-German
war, and in this respect France is
stronger than her great continental neighbors.</p>

<p>The following table, compiled from Mulhall’s

<p>So much for the financial condition of France.
As regards her ability to cope with England in
the event of war, it is largely a matter of opinion.
One hazards little in predicting that, if
her people stand united, France is almost impregnable
at home to any assault from Great
Britain. So is the latter against any attack from
the former, except in Ireland. On the sea England’s
navy is far more than a match for that of
France, whom she would easily strip of all
her colonial possessions; but France, with a few
Alabamas, could quite as easily drive Great
Britain’s merchant marine from the high seas,
and injure her commerce even more than the
Confederates did ours during the recent rebellion.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">BAROMETRICAL QUERIES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Wilber</span>, Kan.<br>
</p>

<p>1. What causes the mercury to sink in a barometer
before a storm? 2. How do persons foretell the
state of the weather from the movements of the barometer?
3. How far ahead can storms be predicted?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">F. J. Elliott.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The sinking of the mercury in the
tube of a barometer is due to the lightness of the
atmosphere, which is indicative, in most cases, of
humidity, or aqueous vapor, in the air. The construction
of a mercurial barometer may be stated
in a few words. A glass tube, about 33 inches in
length, open at one end, is filled with mercury,
and while the unsealed end is covered, is inverted
in a basin of mercury. As soon as the
cover is removed the mercury in the tube will
flow out until it stands about thirty inches above
the mercury in the basin. At that point the
pressure of the air upon the liquid in the basin is
equal to the pressure of the liquid
in the tube (the space in the upper
part of the tube being a vacuum) and the flow
ceases. When the air becomes heavier its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
pressure upon the basin will be greater and force
the mercury in the tube higher; if the air becomes
lighter the mercury in the tube will sink.
The barometer therefore shows directly only the
weight of the atmosphere, but thereby indirectly
the future state of the weather is indicated. 2.
This is explained in “Our Curiosity Shop” for
1881, pages 144-5. 3. How far ahead the
changes of weather can be predicted depends
upon so many other considerations besides that
of the mere weight of the atmosphere, varying in
different seasons of the year and different localities,
that no answer suited to all can be given.
In some instances storms have been predicted
from observations of the barometer alone as
much as thirty-six to forty hours before their
arrival. The United States Signal Service bases
its weather predictions not only on barometric
phenomena, but on telegraphic reports from a
multitude of stations of the temperature,
humidity, clouds, direction, force and rate of
motion of the winds, etc. In some cases it has
given notice of storms starting in the Rocky
Mountains and traveling eastward sixty hours
before their arrival on the Atlantic seaboard.</p>

<p>Please give a biographical sketch of Professor
Agassiz.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">R. A. Coats.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Louis John Rudolf Agassiz, the son
of a Swiss Protestant clergyman, was born near
Lake Neuchatel, May 28, 1807. After completing
his academical course, he studied medicine at
Zurich, Heidelberg, and Munich, preparatory to
becoming a physician. Meanwhile Spix and Martins
had returned from Brazil with a valuable
collection of fossil fishes; and when, in 1826, the
death of Spix made it necessary to select some
one to continue the classification of his specimens,
the choice fell upon Agassiz, who had
already shown great ability in zoological research.
Thus suddenly, at the age of 18, he began what
was to be his life-long study. His next work was
the study of the fresh water fishes of Central
Europe, of which he published a history in 1839.
In 1834 he paid his first visit to England, drawn
thither by the tempting field of investigation in
the fossils of the Devonian rocks. At about this
time Agassiz commenced a new classification of
fishes, based upon the character of the skin.
Four years later he accepted a professorship at
Neuchatel; and while there published his works
on “Fishes of Central Europe.” “Mollusca,” and
“Glaciers.” The last named work was the result
of his study with Charpentier, during the year
1840. In 1847 he came to the United States, and
became Professor of Zoology and Geology in
Harvard. His life in this country was characterized
by increased vigor as a writer. Failing
health made a change of climate necessary in 1865,

<p><em>Answer.</em>—An experienced poultry-raiser gives
the following rules, which he says a close observer
can soon learn to apply without mistake:
The drake wheezes, the duck quacks. The Guinea
cock and hen both have a peculiar, disagreeable
chatter, but the hen sometimes says “buckwheat”
or “go back” which the cock never does.
The peacock can be distinguished, even when only
a few months old, by the foxy red pinion feathers
of his wings. In the case of turkeys, the breastbone
of the cock is turned out at the front point,
while that of the hen is straight. As to geese, the
gabble of the common, the Embden and the
Toulouse ganders is faster, finer, and higher than
that of the goose, which is a slow, low bass; and
the screech of the gander is fine, loud, and clear,
while that of the goose is a rough bass. Both
gander and goose of the English gray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
geese have a coarse screech and gabble,
but the screech of the goose is lazy and
seems to be partly broken, making two sounds,
while the gander gives one clear, loud screech
without any break in it. The screech of the
African gander is loud and hoarse, while that of
the goose is clear and stops abruptly, as if bitten
off at the end. The Chinese gander gives one loud,
clear screech, but that of the goose seems to be
broken, making two different sounds, as if the
first were made by forcing her breath out and the
other by drawing it back.</p>

<p>What is meant by “an international date line?”</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Constant Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Every person traveling around the
world from west to east, with his watch or
chronometer set to the time of the place at
which he started, will note that the sun comes to
his meridian, or noon, four minutes earlier than
his chronometer time for every degree passed
over, one hour for every 15 degrees, and twenty-four
hours for 360 degrees, the total circuit of
the earth. In other words, every one who completes
such a journey gains a day, and to dispose
of this superfluous day so as to make
his reckoning correspond with that of
his starting place, he must call the day on which
he gets back (or on which he passes
some certain point or meridian line)
and the next following day of the week and
month by the same name and date; thus having
two Mondays, for example, together. On the
other hand, every person traveling from east to
west loses a day in making a complete circuit of
the earth, and to correct his calendar must skip
one day of some week.</p>

<p>Suppose it were universally agreed that
this correction of the navigator’s reckoning
should be made at the 180th degree
of longitude west and east from Greenwich, Eng.,
then this would be the international date line.
Unfortunately, now, there is no such universally
accepted line, although most merchant vessels of
all nations do make the correction at the meridian
above named. So it often happens that
sailors in the Pacific Ocean, because their vessels
reach the 180th meridian coming eastward on
Sunday enjoy two Sundays together, and going
westward have two weeks without any intervening
Sunday. It has been proposed to fix by international
agreement upon this or some other line
for this correction of dates so as to make all ship
calendars agree, but thus far a silly national
pride and other insufficient reasons have prevented
such an agreement. The meridian of
Rome, as the center from which Christian civilization
was disseminated both towards the East
and West, has been proposed by some. It has
the advantage of being nearly upon the meridian
of the most of the great observatories of
Europe—those of Modena, Verona, Naples, Palermo,
Padua, Venice, Munich, Leipsic, Prague,
Berlin, Gotha, Copenhagen, Uraniburg, and
Christiana. This would locate the 180th degree
of longitude in Behring Straits.</p>

<p>If such a line could be determined, and local
calendars the world over be made to correspond,
it would dispose of such absurdities in reckoning
as exist now, when it is a fact that during five
hours of every day there are three different dates
in use in different parts of the world. For example:
From 5:10 o’clock a. m. to 10:10 o’clock
a. m. of to-day, Sept. 17, 1883, at Chicago, the
inhabitants of the Navigator Islands, in the
Pacific, are in the early part of their Sept. 18,
while those of the Philippine Islands, about sixty
degrees further west, adhering to their old calendar,
are finishing Sept. 16. That is to say,
from the time any given day of the week and
month begins at the earliest place of reckoning to
the time it ends at the latest place is about fifty-three
hours. This is accounted for by the fact
that places discovered and receiving civilization
by Eastern communication from Europe, and
those receiving it by Western communication,
took their dates from opposite directions without
allowing for the day lost in circumnavigating the
globe in the one direction and the day gained in
circumnavigating it in the other. The Philippine
Islands were discovered by Magellan,
sailing westward, and conquered by a Spanish expedition
dispatched from the west coast of
Mexico, which accounts for the use there of a
dating later by a day than that of the neighboring
island of Hong Kong, on the China coast, and the
Japanese islands; in fact, the latest dating of any
place on the globe.</p>

she may agree to waive a part, or all, of her right;
or the husband may concede more than her dower

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Most of Nebraska between Ft. Kearney
and the western State line is open to homesteaders,
but perhaps the greatest immigration at
this time is to the Niobrara Valley. The Platte
Valley is also very fertile. The agricultural
country extends 180 miles west of the Missouri
River, and produces great harvests of grain, flax,
hemp, and all vegetables: while south of latitude
42 degrees the common small fruits grow in
abundance. When Central Kansas and Nebraska
are settled, what is now generally regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
as the “great corn belt” will be under
cultivation. The portion of the State devoted to
grazing comprises 23,000,000 acres, generally
well watered, with Ogallala as a center. Except
in the valleys, the water lies from 100 to 200 feet
below the surface of the ground, and is obtained
by boring. The sandy tracts are subject
to drought, but where the subsoil is dry clay the
ground is usually moist. Custer County is settling
rapidly, although it has the reputation of
being sandy, and adapted for the most part only to
grazing. The mean temperature of the State is
in winter from 22 to 30 degrees, and in summer
from 70 to 74 degrees. The rainfall (greatest in
May and June) averages about thirty inches
in all but the extreme northwestern corner of the

<p>Please give the definition of feudalism?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">H. B. Haskell.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Feudalism is the state of society in
which all landed property is considered as belonging
to the crown. It is apportioned by the
Kings to the nobles, as feudatories, upon condition
that they render annually a certain amount
of military service. These proprietors may, in
turn, partition their lands to sub-tenants in consideration
of like military service.</p>

<p>Feudal proprietors at first held their lands from a
superior for life; later as an inheritance. The great
feudatories lived in fortified castles, surrounded
by villages of peasants who tilled their lands. In
all matters of jurisprudence they exercised supreme
authority over their dependents. To other
feudatory lords each might stand in the relation of
friend or foe, though he met with them as peers
in the periodical councils of the realm. Among
the services required from their dependents or
vassals, were military service, when called upon,
contribution toward the expenses of war, toward
ransom of their lord if taken captive, toward
marriage expenses of his son, and dowry of his
daughter.</p>

true maiden name and the main facts of her life.</p>

<p class="right">
Cymbeline.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Adelina Patti’s real name before her
marriage was Adele Juana Maria Patti. She is a
native of Spain, being born at Madrid April 9,
1843. She inherited her talent to some degree
from her mother, Mme. Barilli Patti, a prima
donna of no mean reputation. It
is stated that she sang “Norma” at the
Grand Theater, Madrid, on the evening
before Adele’s birth, and, as she
lost much of the power and sweetness of her
voice after that event, she always maintained
that it had gone from her into the child. Adele
has been claimed as an American, because the
family came to this country the next year after
her birth, and her brilliant fame dawned upon
her in New York City. At the age of 9 she made
her first appearance before the public, and made
the tour of Canada with Strakosch and Ole Bull.
She made her debut in New York City March 3,
1854, at Paul Jullien’s concert, in the City Assembly
rooms. Then she accompanied Gottschalk,
the great pianist, to the West
Indies. It was at this time that she
sung in costume with Signor Barilli at Havana
the duet in the “Barber of Seville” with such
effect that the audience became excited to such a
pitch and clamored so wildly for her to reappear
that she ran away in a fright, and nothing could
persuade her to return. Returning to New York
she was more popular than ever. It was in
November of 1859 that the managers of the
Academy of Music, New York, after a long period
of unprofitable engagements which threatened
to end in financial ruin, brought forward
Adelina Patti as Lucia. The
result was an immense success. From that time
she was the pet of the metropolis.</p>

<p>She made her debut in London as Amina in
“La Somnambula” in 1861. In England and on
the Continent she soon won her way to the first
rank among prima donnas. Devotees of the
opera, of all ranks, showered favors upon her.
The Emperor of Russia, in 1870, conferred on
her the Order of Merit. Her voice is an unusually
high soprano of rich, bell-like quality, and
remarkable evenness of tone, to which qualities
she adds purity of style and high artistic finish.
Equally at home in the tenderness of deep passion
and the sprightly vivacity of light comedy,
she has also sung with success in oratorio. She
was married in London July 29, 1868, to the
Marquis de Caux, an almost impecunious scion of
the old French nobility. It was an unhappy alliance
and has ended in a divorce granted by the
French courts to the Marquis, in 1876. According
to French law she is not entitled to marry,
but, nevertheless, she now claims to be legally
married to Nicolini.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Columbia River rises in a trivial

in latitude 50 deg. 31 min. north, and
longitude 116 deg. west of Greenwich. It is a
swift, tortuous stream, cutting its way through
many wild, deep gorges, or canons, and obstructed
by numerous rapids and falls, until it
reaches the foot of the Cascades, a series of rapids
where it makes its way through the Cascade
Mountains. Here the scene on either hand is
most impressive, rising in places to the height of
sublimity. From where the Clarke River fork
enters to the sea the Columbia forms the
boundary between Oregon and Washington Territory.
Its total length is variously estimated,
the best authorities making it between 1,400 and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
1,450 miles. It is navigable for sea-going vessels
of 300 tons burden to the head of tide water, at

James Russell Lowell, a native of Boston, and
already known as a poet through his “Legend of
Brittany,” published in 1844. In 1854 he succeeded
Longfellow as Professor of Modern Languages
at Harvard. During 1857-62 he was editor
of the “Atlantic Monthly,” and 1863-72 of
the “North American Review.” In 1869 he published
a volume of poems and in 1870 a second
volume, followed in 1871 by “My Study Windows.”
Four years ago he became United States

Some of the most common of the sports connected
with it are these: If you go down the cellar
stairs backwards or into a dark room, holding
a lighted candle in one hand and a looking-glass
in the other, the face of your “destiny” will appear
over your left shoulder. Walk around the
house three times with a broom over your right
shoulder, and you will see the same person, or go
down cellar backwards combing your hair and
carrying a candle. These things must be done

<p>In answer to H. H. H., of Chicago, who asks in
Our Curiosity Shop which is the oldest lake craft
now in service, I will say: The oldest lake craft
now in service is said to be the Racine, built at
Cleveland in 1844; the next is Genesee Chief, 1846.
Among some of the other old-timers still in service
are the barge Seminole, 38 years old; Pilgrim,
35 years; Two Brothers, 37 years; Reindeer,
35 years; schooners Arcturus, 30 years;
Cascade, 30 years; Elbe, 30 years; Sonora, 29
years; Clipper City, 29 years; Vermont, 30 years;
Pilot, 35 years; Harriet Ross, age unknown. The
oldest American vessel now coasting on the ocean
is the bark Amethyst, built in 1822. The following
will prove of interest to old Chicagoans, who
will no doubt recollect the circumstances: The
first craft built in Chicago was the sloop Clarisa,
1836; the first steamboats, James Allen, 213
tons; G. W. Dole, 162 tons burden, built in 1838.
The first sail arrival at Chicago was the schooner
General Tracy, from Detroit, in 1803. The first
steamer arrival was the Superior, with United
States troops, in 1832. The first tugboat in Chicago
harbor was the Archimedes, a side-wheeler,
exploded in 1852. The schooner Illinois was the
first sail craft to enter the Chicago River over
the bar, July 14, 1834. The schooners La-Grange,
United States, Oregon, and Illinois
were some of the pioneer packet vessels sailing
between Buffalo and Chicago in 1830, carrying
passengers and freight. The little steamer called
Chicago plied on the river, and in 1836 carried
the Governor and party up to Bridgeport, where
the first shovelful of sand was dug for the canal.</p>

<p>In connection with the above, to show what a
vessel can do in her time, I will mention as an
example: The old packet ship Great Western,
built over forty years ago, plying between New
York and Liverpool, 1,800 tons burden. This
vessel sailed twenty-nine years in the packet line
without losing one of her crew; also during 116
trips she never lost a sail or spar. She has carried
30,000 passengers from Europe to America; 200
marriages, and 1,500 births occurred on board of
her. Ten years ago she was sent to the Pacific
Ocean, being a very successful craft. She caught
fire and burned to the water’s edge in San Francisco
during the past summer. For marine history

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The first Congress that assembled
under our present Constitution passed the first
tariff. In the preamble to that act it is expressly
affirmed that such tariff was necessary “to pay the
public debt, provide revenue, etc., and for the
protection and encouragement of American manufactures.”
The necessity of such protection was
urged in the messages of Presidents George Washington,
Thomas Jefferson, James Madison James
Monroe, John Q. Adams, and Andrew Jackson.
In his annual message of Dec. 15, 1802, among
other proper objects of government, Jefferson
enumerates the following; “To foster our fisheries
as nurseries of navigation and for the nurture of
man; and to <em>protect the manufactures</em> adapted to
our circumstances.” In his annual message of
1806, apprehending a surplus revenue,
he says; “To what other objects
shall these surpluses be appropriated, and the
whole surplus of impost after the entire discharge
of the public debt? Shall we suppress the impost
(or tariff) and give that advantage to foreign
over domestic manufactures?” He then suggests
that on a few articles the impost might be
wisely suppressed, but in regard to the great mass
of them he says; “The patriotism of the people
would prefer its continuance and application to
the great purposes of public education, roads,
rivers, canals, and other objects of public improvement.”
In his message of Nov. 8, 1808, after referring
with gratification to the increase of “internal
manufactures and improvements,” he expresses
the hope that such establishments of
manufacturing industry “formed and forming,
will, under the auspices of cheaper materials and
substance, the freedom of labor from taxation
with us, and of <em>protecting duties</em> and <em>prohibitions</em>,
become permanent.” Says President Monroe, in
his inaugural address of March 5, 1817; “Our
manufactures will likewise require the systematic
and fostering care of the government. Possessing,
as we do, all the raw materials, the fruit of our own
soil and industry, we ought not to depend, in the
degree we have done, on supplies from other
countries. It is important, too, that the capital
which nourishes our manufactures should
be domestic, as its influences in that case, instead
of exhausting, as it may do in foreign hands,
would be felt advantageously for agriculture and
every other branch or industry. Equally important
is it to provide at home a market for our
raw materials, as by extending the competition it
will enhance the price and protect the cultivator
against the casualties incident to foreign markets.”</p>

<p>In his message of Dec. 7, 1830, General Jackson
says: “The power to impose duties on imports
originally belonged to the several States.
The right to adjust these duties, with the view to the
encouragement of domestic branches of industry,
is so completely incidental to that power, that it
is difficult to suppose the existence of the one
without the other.” He proceeds to say that the
denial of the right of the Federal Government
“to exercise this power for the purpose of protection
would he to present the anomaly of a
people stripped of the right to foster their own
industry, and to counteract the most selfish and
destructive policy which might be adopted by
foreign nations. This surely cannot be the case.
This indispensable power, thus surrendered by
the States, must be within the scope of the
authority on the subject expressly delegated to
Congress. In this conclusion I am confirmed
as well by the opinions of
Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Madison,
and Monroe, who have each repeatedly recommended
the exercise of this right under the
Constitution, as by the uniform practice of Congress,
the continued acquiescence of the States,
and the general understanding of the people.”
In a letter to Dr. Coleman, of North Carolina,
dated at Washington City, April 20, 1824, General
Jackson wrote: “If we omit or refuse to use
the gifts which Providence has extended to us,
we deserve not the continuation of His blessing.
He has filled our mountains and our plains with
minerals—with lead, iron, and copper—and given
us a climate and soil for the growing of hemp
and wool. These being the great materials of
our National defense, they ought to have extended
to them adequate protection; that our
manufacturers and laborers may be placed in a
fair competition with those of Europe, and that
we have within our country a supply of those
leading and important articles so essential to
war. I will ask what is the real situation of the
agriculturist? Where has the American farmer a
market for his surplus produce? Except for
cotton he has neither a foreign nor a home market.
Common sense at once points out the remedy.
Take from agriculture in the United States
600,000 men, women, and children and
you will at once give a market for more
breadstuffs than all Europe now furnishes
us. In short, sir, we have been
too long subject to the policy of British merchants.
It is time we should become a little
more Americanized, and instead of feeding paupers
and laborers of England, feed our own, or
else in a short time, by continuing our present
policy, we shall be rendered paupers ourselves.”
In consonance with these sentiments, Jackson,
together with Martin Van Buren and Silas
Wright, the leaders of the Northern Democracy,
and the great mass of the Jackson representatives
from the free States, voted for the tariff of
1828, the highest protective tariff ever levied in
this country before the war of the rebellion. In
the next subsequent decade the Democratic
party, led by the cotton States, and determined
to defeat the Whig party led by the great Protectionist,
Henry Clay, espoused free trade.</p>

<p>Who and what was Don Carlos?</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—1. There was a Don Carlos in the
sixteenth century. He was the son of Philip II.,
of Spain; was born at Valladolid in 1545, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
recognized as heir to the throne in 1560. But
owing to his dullness at school, and distaste for
study, the King deemed him unfit to reign over
his subjects, and invited the Prince’s cousin, the
Archduke Rudolf, to Spain, intending to educate
him for the throne. Jealous of this usurper, Don
Carlos conceived a strong dislike to all the King’s
counselors, whom he plotted to destroy. But
having foolishly divulged to his confessor that
he intended to murder some one, that some one
was suspected to be the King. The stupid Prince
was tried and convicted of high treason, and left
to the mercy of the King. Philip declared that
he could make no exception in favor of such an
ungrateful son, but there is found no formal
record of any sentence of death. Don Carlos died
soon afterward, at the age of 23. 2. The Don
Carlos who has of late years been causing so
much trouble in Spain, as a pretender to the
throne, is the eldest son of the brother of King
Fernando VII. His wife is Princess Marguerite, of
Bourbon, daughter of Duke Carlos III., of Parma.
He is a brother of the ex-Queen Isabella, and
uncle to the present King.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">F. J. Hall.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—In the report of the United States
Commissioner of Education for 1880 the following
statistics of schools in the United States not
under State control are given: One hundred and
sixty-two commercial and business colleges, generally
self-supporting, and unconnected with, or
not dependent on, Christian or other benevolent
organizations or private benevolence. There
were 232 kindergartens, most of which were private
schools and self-supporting. Such as were
charity schools, like the free kindergartens of
certain cities, were supported, for the most part,
by Christian benevolence. There were 1,264
“schools of secondary instruction,” such as seminaries
and academies; 355 asylums for
orphans, 142 theological schools, and 227
“institutions for the superior instruction
of women.” Most of all four classes
of schools were and still are under the direction
of Roman Catholics, Protestants or Hebrews. Of
the 364 universities and colleges, only eighty are
marked non-sectarian, and to these institutions
are attached nearly all the 310 theological, law,
and medical schools. There are forty-nine schools
of science, (mining, engineering, agriculture, etc.),
endowed with the National land grants, apportioned
to the several States under act of 1862, the
States providing in nearly every instance the
grounds, buildings, apparatus, etc., and supplementing
the income of the endowment fund.
Even many of these schools, such as Purdue University,
Indiana, Illinois Industrial University,
and others, are indebted to private individuals, or
county and city subscriptions for handsome contributions
in money, lands, etc. Then there are
thirty-five schools and collegiate departments of
science not endowed by the National land grants
or State grants, but almost wholly the product
of private benefactions, the benefactors in nearly
all cases being pronounced Christian philanthropists.
The benefactions to educational institutions
of the United States, (mostly denominational), in
the years ending with 1880, amounted to about
$60,000,000.</p>

<p>If by “infidels,” you intend persons who disclaim
all faith in Christianity, then it is doubtful
if any of the above institutions were founded or
are sustained to any degree worthy of mention, by
an infidel. Even Girard, the founder of Girard
College was not an out and out atheist or deist,
though he was bitterly opposed to all existing
sects, and had a strong aversion to the clergy of
every denomination.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Edward Richard Spriggs Canby
LL. D., was born in Kentucky in 1807, graduated
at West Point in 1839, and spent the remainder
of his life on the warpath. His first
post was in Florida (1839-42), but he was little
known until the war with Mexico, when he fought
with such valor at Cherubusco and the City of
Mexico as to win the brevets of major and
lieutenant colonel. From 1849 to 1861 he served
on the Pacific coast, in Washington, and Utah
Territory, and against the Navajoes, and at the
outbreak of the civil war took command
in New Mexico, where he was
brevetted brigadier general at Valverde. Two
years later he was commander of the expedition
which captured Mobile, and there won the title of
brevet major general. Soon afterward Generals
R. Taylor and E. K. Smith surrendered to him.
In 1866 he was made a brigadier general in the
regular army.</p>

<p>In 1869, having served in several important
commissions, and being worn out, he voluntarily
consented to take charge of the Department of
Columbia; and there he was treacherously shot
by the chief “Jack,” April 11, 1873, while trying

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="smcap">Blunt</span>, D.T.<br>
</p>

<p>Please explain in the Curiosity Shop the meaning of
the expression “Precession of the Equinoxes,” and
how the climate of the earth is affected by this phenomenon?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Arthur Snow.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—As the plane of the earth’s orbit
crosses the equator at an angle of about 23½
degrees, the attractive force of the sun, moon,
and planets, constantly exerted upon the earth,
has a tendency to tilt the pole away from the sun
and to draw the equator toward it. As a consequence,
the sun crosses the equator each time a
little farther west than the point where it crossed
the last time preceding, and where it
would have crossed on its return if
there were no disturbing force. Originally it was
said that the equinoctial point, or place of crossing,
went forward to meet the sun, and hence this
phenomenon was called the precession of the equinoxes.
But, from the fact that the equinoctial
point really falls backwards on the celestial equator,
toward the west, each time about 50 seconds
of a degree, it is now very frequently termed the
recession of the equinoxes. In consequence of
this recession the seasons begin a little earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
each year, and it is estimated that in 12,800
years they will be reversed, our summer occurring
when the sun is in the constellation that he now
traverses in winter time. It requires about 25,000
years for the sun to complete one circuit of
precession of the equinoxes.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It is generally admitted that the
comet discovered by Professor Brooks on the 5th
of September last, and now visible, with the aid
of a good opera or field glass, in the constellation
Draco, between the “Great Dipper,” in Ursa Major,
and the “Northern Cross,” in the Constellation
Cygnus, is identical with the comet of 1812,
which was believed by the superstitious to prognosticate
our last war with Great Britain. It will
reach perihelion, or the point in its orbit nearest
the sun, Jan. 25. It will increase in brightness
rapidly from the first of December, and be plainly
visible to the naked eye by the middle of that
month. At its brightest it will be brighter than
in 1812, but it will not equal at any time the
magnificent comet of 1882. The period, as calculated
in 1812, was 70.6 years. As the interval
between its perihelion time, Sept. 15, 1812, and
its perihelion passage, Jan. 25, 1884, will be but
71.5 years, it is not strange astronomers—considering
the imperfections of astronomical
science and art then as compared with the state
of astronomy now—are not surprised at this
small error in this comet’s calculated orbital
period.</p>

fifty-four railroad companies operating roads in
Illinois. Poor’s “Manual” gives the names of sixty-five
companies operating roads in the State in
1882. It is difficult to state how many companies
own these roads, for every year many of
them change hands by lease or sale. There are
more companies owning roads than there are
operating companies. For instance, during the
years 1880-81 six railroads were merged into the
Wabash system, another was purchased by the
Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company,
and still another was leased for an indefinite
period by the Cincinnati, Indianapolis,
St. Louis and Chicago. Probably the next annual

controversy.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Aaron.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It is not true. After all the pains
taken by scientists to obtain the exact measure of
a quadrant of a meridian of the earth, it
is now conceded that this problem is
still unsolved. In the latter part of last
century, certain French astronomers and
geodetic surveyors persuaded the French Academy
of Sciences that they had succeeded in
measuring so much of such an arc as enabled
them to accurately determine the whole arc by
geometrical calculations. In this belief what is
now known as the metric system of measures
was constructed, and under the French Republic,
in 1795, the existing standards of French measures
were adopted, based on the meter, the ten-millionth
part of the earth’s meridian quadrant
as thus computed. According to this a meter is
39.368 American inches, or 39.37 English inches.
But while later surveys have failed to determine
the quadrant with absolute certainty, it is conceded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
that they have demonstrated the inaccuracy
of the earlier surveys and computations, and
what is now generally accepted as a very close approximation
to an exact measure shows that the
standard French meter falls short of the ten-millionth
part of the earth’s meridional
quadrant by its 1-5,400 part. That is,
according to the progress of more extended
geodetic measurements, brought down to
1875, the earth’s meridional quadrant exceeds
10,000,000 meters by about 1,850 meters. Nevertheless
the International Bureau of Weights
and Measures very wisely adheres to the original
standard meter, represented by the platinum
meter of the French archives as the fundamental
unit of the metric system.</p>

witchcraft at Salem and elsewhere. Respecting Salem

and names and characters of the men upholding
the persecutions?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">H. F. Fehlandt.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Salem witchcraft was only one
of the results of the superstition, as old almost
as man himself, that certain persons, through intimate
connection with the spirit world, possess
superhuman influence for evil over their fellow-men.
The early Christians inherited the idea
from their pagan forefathers, and in 1484 Pope
Innocent issued a bull directing the inquisitors to
search out and punish all guilty of such crimes.
For nearly three centuries following the delusion
reigned, so that in Germany alone more than 10,000
persons were executed in consequence of this
bull, and in England, during the 150 years following
the reign of Elizabeth, over 30,000 persons
were sacrificed to this wild superstition. In
fact witches were hung in the latter country as
late as 1716, and in Scotland until 1722.
Under these circumstances it is not
strange that Englishmen in America partook of
the fanatical excitement, and when in 1688 four
children of John Goodwin, a respectable man in
North Boston, began to show strange symptoms,
immediately after receiving abuse from a disreputable
Irish woman, the people should at once
attribute them to witchcraft; the more so since
three Bostonians had been hung already for that
offense, and lately a book had been published in
defense of the popular belief. Four years later
the excitement culminated at Salem. The first
alleged victims were in the family of Samuel
Parris, a clergyman. His daughter, niece, and
two other girls began to show symptoms like
those of the Goodwin children, and accused
Tituba, an Indian squaw in the family, of bewitching
them, though she stoutly protested her
Innocence. Soon the number of bewitched increased,
and likewise the number of accused.
The excitement grew, being constantly
fanned by those who should have been foremost
in checking it. None were safe from
accusation, and many, to save their own lives,
accused their dearest friends and relatives.
When Sir William Phipps became Governor of
Massachusetts, in May, 1692, his first act was
the appointment of a court for Suffolk, Essex,
and Middlesex, consisting of seven judges: William
Stoughton, the Lieutenant Governor; Chief
Justice Nathaniel Saltonstal, who refused to act,
and was replaced by Jonathan Curwin; John
Richards, Bartholomew Gedney, Wait Winthrop,
Samuel Sewall, and Peter Sergeant. Cotton
Mather and Samuel Parris were among the chief
Instigators of the prosecutions that followed.
Under this tribunal twenty persons were hung,
fifty or more tortured into confession of guilt;
the jails were filled, and hundreds more were under
suspicion, when the reason of the community
awoke to a realization of the injustice and barbarity
of such proceedings, and fanaticism was
soon succeeded by bitter remorse. There is not
space here to enumerate many of the tortures
employed to extort confessions. The lash, the
stocks, binding the sufferers in painful postures,
as with neck and heels together; starvation and
thirst, and other barbarities were exercised, until
hundreds falsely accused themselves, their
friends and neighbors, and even their dearest
relatives, to obtain release.</p>

<span class="smcap">Charles Seymour.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It is impossible to give a definite
answer to this question. The military term “legion”
was not a very definite term, as regards
numbers, even in the case of the old Roman legion,
where it corresponded somewhat to the
modern “army corps.” Sometimes it numbered
3,000 men and at others 6,000 or more. In 1792
the whole army of the United States
was officially designated the “Legion of
the United States” the Infantry regiments
being styled “sub-legions.” This was
not a popular organization and nomenclature
with army men, and was soon abandoned. The
term has been applied in modern times to divisions

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The “Madonna di San Sisto” was
executed by Raphael as an altar-piece for the
Church of St. Sixtus at Piacenza, in Northern
Italy. It is perhaps the most widely known of
Raphael’s works, and universally regarded one of
his supreme efforts. Mrs. Jameson, renowned as an
art critic, says of it; “For myself, I have seen my
ideal once, and once only, there where Raphael—inspired,
if ever a painter was inspired—projected
on the space before him that wonderful
creature which we style the Madonna di San
Sisto.” It was painted between 1517 and 1520.
We are not positive as to when and by whom it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
was removed to Dresden, but think it was during
the reign of Frederick Augustus II., King of

<p><em>Answer.</em>—A detailed reply to this question
cannot fail to interest the readers of Our Curiosity
Shop, since it will enable them to appreciate
more fully the strides of progress made in interstate
communication since this government was
formed. It is impossible to fully estimate the
service cheap postage on letters, newspapers
magazines, and books, and of late on seeds, samples
of merchandise, etc., has rendered in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
marvelous intellectual, moral, and material development
of this country. The postal service is
one of the most beneficent, as it is one of the
most potent, forces in the control of the Federal
Government. As a bond of union between the
States its influence is of inestimable value. It
is a life-long school of patriotism, minifying and
almost annihilating the alienating force of distances,
keeping the links of friendship bright
and strong between old friends scattered throughout
the land, familiarizing voters with the condition
of all parts of the country, and fostering
the common good in innumerable ways.</p>

<p>From the organization of the Postoffice Department,
in 1786, to 1816 the rates on domestic
letters (or letters for any place within the United
States) were as follows: “For each piece of paper
of which a single letter, or letter packet, may be
composed,” under 40 miles, 8 cents; under 90
miles, 10 cents; under 150 miles, 12½ cents; under
300 miles, 17 cents; under 500 miles, 20
cents; over 500 miles 25 cents.</p>

<p>In 1816 the following schedule went into force:
For a single letter carried not over 30 miles, 6¼
cents; less than 80 miles, 10 cents; less than 150
miles, 12½ cents; less than 400 miles, 18¾ cents;
over 400 miles, 25 cents. Provisions for mailing
newspapers were made as follows: Newspapers,
under 100 miles or within the State where published,
1 cent; over 100 miles and out of the
State, 1½ cents.</p>

<p>By the act of March 3, 1845, the rates were
modified as follows: For each letter weighing less
than half an ounce, if carried less than
300 miles, 5 cents; over 300 miles,
10 cents; each additional half ounce, double
rates; drop letters delivered from the office where
posted, 2 cents. The newspaper rates were: For
papers containing less than 1,900 square inches,
1 cent each, if delivered within the State where
printed and mailed, or out of the State but within
100 miles of publication office; for any greater
distance, 1½ cents each; if conveyed less than
30 miles, free. Papers measuring over 1,900
square inches were charged magazine postage.
Magazines, pamphlets, and other printed works
were charged 2½ cents for the first ounce, and 1
cent for each additional ounce or fraction of an
ounce, for any distance whatever. Bound books
were unmailable. Carriage by private individuals
on mail carriages, or by express, thenceforward,
was prohibited. Two years later
transient newspaper rates were raised to 3 cents,
and prepayment was required; postage on unsealed
circulars was raised from 2 cents to 3;
newspaper postage to Oregon and California was
placed at 4½ cents, and letters, via Chagres and
Panama, 40 cents; between post towns in California,
12½ cents.</p>

<p>In 1849 the postage on transient newspapers
was reduced to ordinary rates, but prepayment
was maintained.</p>

<p>In 1851 the single letter was defined by weight
instead of by piece, at a half ounce or under, and
rates were greatly cheapened, as follows: For a
single letter under 3,000 miles, 3 cents, if prepaid;
otherwise, 5 cents; over 3,000 miles, 6 cents, or
12 cents. The postage on newspapers, which had
been almost prohibitory in the early days, and had
been maintained at high rates until this time,
was now (1851) greatly reduced, as will be seen
by comparing the following quarterly charges
with the charges per copy given above:</p>

<p>Weekly newspapers, to actual subscribers in
the county, free; under 50 miles and out of
county where published, 5 cents a quarter; over
50 and under 300 miles, 10 cents; over 300 and
under 1,000 miles, 15 cents; over 1,000 and under
2,000, 20 cents; over 2,000 and under
4,000, 25 cents; over 4,000, 30 cents.
Postage on transient newspapers and circulars
was also proportionately reduced, and
books under 32 ounces were admitted to mail at
1 cent an ounce if prepaid, if not prepaid 2 cents.</p>

<p>Slight changes were made in 1852 and 1855,
but it was reserved for the Congress of 1863 to
make the next great step forward by making the
rate of postage on all domestic letters uniform
throughout the Union, at 3 cents for each half
ounce or fraction thereof. At the same time the
quarterly postage on newspapers and periodicals
sent to subscribers, and not exceeding 4 cents,
was made uniform for all distances, at the following
rates; Weekly, 5 cents; semi-weekly, 10
cents; tri-weekly, 15 cents; six times a week, 30
cents; seven times, 35 cents. But in 1868 the
law was so amended as to allow weekly newspapers
to go to regular subscribers in the county
free. No modification of domestic letter rates occurred
after this until the new postal law of this
year, which went into effect Oct. 1, reducing the
single letter rate to 2 cents. An important
change as to newspapers and periodicals was
made in 1872, requiring prepayment in advance
either at the mailing or the delivery office. In
1874 it was made payable at mailing office exclusively,
and a still more important change was
made in the reduction of the rate on such matter
to only 2 cents per pound or fraction thereof.</p>

<p>Stamps and stamped envelopes were first introduced
in 1851, the registry of valuable letters
in 1855, the carrier delivery system in 1863, the
money-order system Nov. 1, 1864, the postal-cards,
at 1 cent each, in 1872.</p>

<p>The foreign postal rates not being subject to
the will of this government only, but being a
matter of international agreement, will be treated
in a separate article.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Webster City</span>, Iowa.<br>
</p>

<p>When and where were steam plows first used? How
are they constructed, and how many acres will they
plow per hour?</p>

<p class="right">
H. C. B.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—An apparatus for steam plowing was
first patented in the United States Nov. 19, 1833,
by E. C. Bellinger, of South Carolina. It was not
received with sufficient favor by farmers or
planters to encourage the manufacture of the
machines. In England, Francis Moor took out a
patent as early as 1769 for an engine to plow,
harrow, and do other farm work without the aid
of horses. Several other attempts at inventing
steam plows were made, but all to no practical
purpose, until 1810, when a Major Pratt patented
a steam-plowing apparatus, employing two engines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
stationed on opposite headlands, and drawing
plows by means of endless chains or ropes.
An improved form of this machine was patented
by Mr. Heathcote, M. P., in 1832, which is said to
be the first that was ever worked successfully in
the field. Alexander McRea made improvements
on Mr. Heathcote’s machine in 1846 and 1849;
still the practical results were insignificant until
in 1854, when John Fowler, also of England,
brought forward an improvement on the plans of
Bellinger, Pratt, and others, since which time
various changes and additions have been made,
and steam plowing has gone into successful practice
on many of the large estates of Great Britain
and in the East and West Indies; about 1,500
steam plows being now in use in England alone.</p>

<p>Many attempts to invent a successful
traction engine for steam plowing have
been made, particularly by Mr. J. Boydell,
of England, in 1846, Mr. Calloway and Mr.
Pukis, of England, in 1851, and in this country
by Joseph W. Fawkes, by Henry Corning in 1850,
David Russell in 1855, B. Crawford in 1857,
Judd Stevens in 1858, particularly, by Thomas
H. Burbridge, of St. Louis, in 1858, and Mr. W.
R. Hinsdale, of New York, about 1870, who invented
a gang of three plows to go with Messrs.
Aveling and Porter’s traction engine, imported
from England by the late Mr. A. T. Stewart, to be
used on his estate at Garden City, Long Island.</p>

<p>The plan called cable traction, invented in part
by Pratt, in part by Bellinger, and improved by
Fowler, has been operated with greater success
than any other. It consists of a single locomotive
engine, of from twelve to fourteen-horse power,
with a windlass under the boiler, around which
passes a single steel-wire cable, which, by means
of hinged clips, lays hold of the cable with a grip
proportioned to the strain. This continuous
cable, twice the width of the plat to be plowed,
passes around a sheave, or pulley-block, fastened
to a self-acting anchor placed on the opposite
side of the field from the engine. This “anchor”
consists of a low truck on four wheels, with
sharp, disk edges, which cut so deep into the soil
that it will not drag when the traction is applied.
A box loaded with stones, or some other
weight, on the outer side of this truck keeps it
from tilting when the power is applied to the
plows. A sheave on the truck gives motion to a
drum which winds up another cable attached to
a post or anchor in the direction in which the
furrows are to succeed each other, so that the
machine warps itself along the headland on which
it is stationed just as fast as the plowing progresses,
keeping at all times directly opposite to
the locomotive engine, which is moving down the
opposite headland in the same direction. The
plows are attached to a balance frame, the especial
invention of Mr. Fowler, and are in duplicate,
pointing to each other, so that when the set at
one end of the frame is at work the opposite set
is carried along the cable in the air. The plow
frame is hauled from one side of the field to the
other, between the engine and the movable
anchor, by reversing the action of
the windlass. It is adapted to turning from two
to eight furrows at once, according to the power
of the engine and toughness of the soil. The
amount of ground plowed by such a machine
varies from three to eight acres a day for a three-furrow
gang, according to depth of furrow from
twelve inches to four inches. An eight-furrow
gang will do a little more than twice this amount
of work per day.</p>

<p>For various reasons steam plowing is not
practiced to any noticeable extent in the United
States, but it is probable that as the advantages
of this mode of turning up the soil to a depth not
practicable by animal draft, become better understood,
and other changes transpire, it will go into
successful operation here as it has done in England.</p>

</p>

<p>Where is the district of country called the “Bad
Lands?” Is it true that it is very remarkable for
fossil remains, and that wood or any animal substance,
if left there for a short time, becomes petrified?</p>

<p class="right">
A. J. P.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The “Bad Lands,” or “Mauvaises
Terres,” of the old French fur-traders’ dialect,
are an extensive barren tract in Dakota, Wyoming,
and Northwestern Nebraska, between the
North Fork of the Platte and the South Fork of
the Cheyenne River—west, south, and southeast
of the Black Hills. It lies mostly between the
103d and 105th degrees of longitude, with an
area as yet not perfectly defined, but estimated
to cover about 60,000 square miles.
There are similar lands in the Green River region
of which Fort Bridger is the center, and in
southeastern Oregon. The following description
applies directly to the district named in the question,
so commonly known in the Northwest as
the “Bad Lands.” They belong to the Miocene
period, geologically speaking. “The surface materials
are for the most part white and yellowish
indurated clays, sands, marls, and occasional
thin beds of lime and sandstone.” It is fitly described
as one of the most wonderful regions of
the globe. It is held by geologists that during
the geological period above named a vast fresh
water lake system covered this portion of our
continent, when the comparatively soft materials
which compose the present surface were deposited.
As these lakes drained off, after the subsidence
of the plains further east, resulting in the formation
of the Missouri Valley, the original lake beds
were worn into canyons that wind in every
conceivable direction. Here and there abrupt,
almost perpendicular portions of the ancient
beds remain in all imaginable forms, some resembling
the ruins of abandoned cities. “Towers,
spires, cathedrals, obelisks, pyramids and monuments”
of various shapes appear on every side,
as far as the eye can range. Says Dr. Hayden, the
earliest explorer of this region, “Not unfrequently
the rising or setting sun will light up these grand
old ruins with a wild, strange beauty, reminding
one of a city illuminated in the night, as seen
from some high point. The harder layers project
from the sides of the canyons with such regularity
that they appear like seats of some vast
weird amphitheater.” Through all this country
rainfall is very light, the earth absorbs the most
of what rain does fall, and water and grass are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
very scanty. The surface-rock is so soft that it
disintegrates rapidly, covering the lower grounds
in many places to a depth of several feet with a
soft, powdery soil unsuited to vegetation,
into which animals sink as in snow,
while when wet it becomes a stiff
mud of impassable depth. The fitness of the
Dakota name for this region, signifying a land
hard to travel over, cannot be called in question.
These lands are plainly unsuited for agriculture,
and with rare exceptions, here and there, are of
little value for grazing purposes. But they are
one of the most astonishing treasuries of fossil
remains to be found anywhere. The soft clayey
deposits are in some places literally filled with
the bones of extinct species of the horse, rhinoceros,
elephant, hog, camel, a deer that strongly
resembled a hog, saber-toothed lions, and other
marvelous creatures, which have rendered this
section of the earth a study of the highest interest
to geologists of all lands. Fossil trees and
shrubs and fruits abound here. All these petrifactions
are the result, in part, of conditions that
do not now exist in the same degree, and required
no one can tell how long. The soft clays
of this region and the climate are still peculiarly
conducive to petrifying animal and vegetable
substances, but this process requires many years
to convert such substances to stone.</p>

<p>Reckoning the pound sterling at its present
value at the United States Custom House, it appears
from the above table that an imperial
bushel of wheat was worth $1.18⅓ in England in
1839, $1.51 in 1845 (the year before the corn
laws were repealed), $2.10 in 1847,
owing to the unusual scarcity in
Europe and other special causes; about
$1.52 in 1848; that the following year
it dropped to $1.22; and that in 1855, owing to
the Crimean war and other influences, it rose to
$2.25. The price continued to decline after 1855
until it reached $1.33 in 1859. Then the opening
of our civil war sent prices up temporarily,
but even before it closed they dropped to the
lowest point touched since the corn laws were repealed,
viz., 40s 2d per quarter, or $1.20 per
bushel—still a shade higher than the price in
1839, six years before the repeal. The good
effects of that repeal must be looked for in other
matters than in the reduction of prices of grain:
in the general revival of manufacturing industries,
the increase of the volume of trade, better wages,
and many other items of prosperity.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The following are some of the many
ways in which “scalpers” or ticket-brokers supply
themselves with tickets that they can afford
to sell at a reduction from the regular prices and
still make a profit: 1. They purchase at a discount
partly-used through tickets between the
large cities, from travelers getting off at intermediate
cities and way stations. As the fares
between the prominent Eastern and Western
railroad centers are usually proportionately
lower than to way stations,
where there is no competition,
travelers often find that they can purchase
through tickets at such prices as make it more
economical for them to get such tickets and sell
the unused mileage to the scalpers, even at a considerable
discount, than to pay full way-passenger
rates. Second—During excursions many
persons use but half of a ticket, and sell the
“return” to the “scalpers” at a discount on full
rates. Third—In railroad wars they can buy
quantities of tickets cheap to retail later, the
railroad companies selling tickets in large quantities
at such times to speculators, who transfer
them to “scalpers” to sell at their convenience,
when the war is ended and rates have increased.
Fourth—Sometimes, while a railroad company is
bound by contract not to sell at less than a
specified rate, it will offer to “scalpers” a commission
large enough to enable them to undersell
the regular ticket agents, who are bound by the
agreements entered into between railroad companies
to sell only at fixed prices. 2. He did.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The negro republic of Liberia owes
its origin and much of its prosperity to American
philanthropy and enterprise. Dec. 31, 1816, a
body of energetic men organized themselves into
the American Colonization Society, with Henry
Clay for President, their aim being to establish
an African colony for freed negroes. Not until
six years later did they succeed in inducing the
African princes of Guinea to favor their plan; but
in 1821 a treaty was concluded by which they
obtained a tract of land 500 miles long and 50
miles wide on the grain coast of Upper Guinea.
Thereupon the society began at once the exportation
of colonists. To each man was given 30
acres, together with the means for cultivating the
land. The first town was Monrovia. The form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
of government adopted was that of the United
States, and the country is universally recognized
as an independent republic. Since 1847, when
the protection of the United States was withdrawn,
Liberia has enjoyed a certain prosperity,
since more schools and churches have been established
in proportion to the population than in
Great Britain or America. But as to wealth and
political influence it has failed. Only about
19,000 negroes have emigrated from our country,
but surrounding tribes have been added gradually
to their territory, and the present population
is estimated to number 1,068,000, of whom
about 18,000 are Americo-Liberians. About
50,000 have learned the English language and
3,000 are Christians. The chief products are
sugar, palm oil, cocoa, cotton, coffee, arrow-root,
and rice.</p>

<p>This shows a total population in 1869 of 1,859,685.
The present population is believed to
be over 2,500,000. By the treaty of 1881 between
the Argentine Confederation and Chili, the
latter concedes to the former all the territory east
of the crest of the eastern ridge of
the Andes, including a small part of
Terra del Fuego, and the greater part
of Patagonia. The form of government is republican.
The President is elected for six years by
an electoral college, composed of 133 representatives
chosen by the several states. The National
Congress is composed of a Senate of twenty-eight
members, two from each state, or province,
and a house of fifty members, apportioned according
to population. There are five ministers,
viz.: The Ministers of Foreign Affairs, the Interior,
Finance, War, and Education. Each of the
provinces has a governor and legislature elected
by a popular vote. A large part of this vast country
consists of rich, alluvial plains, called pampas,
similar to the prairies of this country, with a soil
four or five feet thick, formed for the most part,
like our prairie soil, by the decay of luxurious
vegetation. Immense herds of cattle and sheep
are raised on these grand prairies, furnishing the
principal exports, hides, tallow, wool, and canned
meats. In 1881 the horned cattle were estimated
at 18,000,000 head, and the sheep at 100,000,000.
The exports of the country amounted to
$56,497,423, and the imports to $54,029,545.
Most of this trade is between Buenos Ayres—the
capital, having a population of about 200,000,
and European, chiefly English, ports. Twelve
lines of steamers run to Europe, making the trip
in an average period of twenty-nine days. The revenue
for 1881 was $24,349,450, derived almost
wholly from import and export dues. The expenditures
amounted to $26,747,480, and the national
debt has grown to $107,681,639, a considerable
part of which is represented by recent public
improvements: railways, bridges, roads, etc.
There are now about 1,600 miles of railway and
10,000 miles of telegraph in the country. The
laws recognize no difference between natives and
foreigners, and of late foreign immigration,
mostly from Spain and Italy, has been flowing in
at a steadily increasing rate, amounting now to
about 50,000 per annum.</p>

the Falcon sailed from New York to Chagres,
stopping at Havana en route, and carrying the
first regularly established United States mail via
the Isthmus. From Chagres it was carried up the
Chagres River, thence overland to Panama, where
it was taken by the California Steampacket Company’s
vessels to San Francisco, Cal., and Astoria,
Oregon. The distance between New York
and Chagres, by this route, was given as 2,860
miles, and from New York to Astoria, 7,500 miles.
The postage on letters between places in Oregon
and California and places on the Atlantic was 40
cents for each half ounce, or fraction thereof;
while local postage between offices in Oregon and
California was 12½ cents per single letter.</p>

</p>

<p>How many cubic feet constitute a ton of hay, and
what length of time is required for it to settle sufficiently
to make measurement correct?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">W. A. Rogers.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Measuring is a very crude, unsatisfactory
method of estimating the weight of hay.
There are times, however, when it is impracticable
to use the scales, and a close approximation
to the true weight will answer all purposes.
Then, by taking into consideration that fine, soft
hay will pack more closely than a coarser, stiffer
quality, that when cut early in the season it will
become more solid than stiff, late-cut hay, that
the degree of dryness when stacked will affect
the weight, that the compactness of the lower
part of a stack or lead is affected by the height,
the time it has stood, or distance and kind of
roads it has traveled over, it is quite possible for
a person of ordinary experience and judgment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
to make an estimate of the quantity
in a load or mow. It is estimated
that, with all the above-mentioned conditions
at an average, timothy, in stacks
of ten feet high and upward, measures about 500
cubic feet to the ton; clear clover, between 600
and 700 cubic feet; new mown hay, about 675
cubic feet; fine hay, well settled, 450 to 500
cubic feet. To find the cubic feet in a circular
stack, multiply the square of the circumference
by four one-hundredths (.04) of the height. Below
is given a set of rules for computing the
number of cubic yards in a ton of hay in the
field, stack, or load, which can be easily reduced
to cubic feet by multiplying the result in cubic
yards by 27:</p>

<p>1. The number of tons of meadow hay in
windrows is the quotient of the product of the
length, breadth, and height, in yards, divided
by 25.</p>

<p>2. To find the number of tons of hay in a mow,
divide the product of the length, height, and
width by 15, if the stack be well packed. If
shallow, and the hay recently stacked, divide by
18, and by any number from 15 to 18 according
to the density of the stack. In square or long
stacks the number of tons is the quotient of the
product of the length of the base, the width, and
half the height, in yards, divided by 15.</p>

<p>3. In loads the number of tons of hay is found
by multiplying together the length, width, and
height, in yards, and dividing the product by 20.</p>

Commodore, Barclay, our defeated enemy, was not
only a brave but a noble-minded man. He was
sadly crippled in that battle, and having been previously
engaged to marry a lady of rank and fortune in
England, after his return to that country he sent a
message to her by a mutual friend, saying that although
his love for her was not abated, yet, as he was
so badly mutilated, if she desired it, he would release
her from her engagement. The noble lady replied
“Tell Commodore Barclay that I will marry him if he
has only body enough left to <em>hold the soul</em>.”</p>

<p class="center no-indent">DEFINITION OF LITERATURE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Weyauwega</span>, Wis.<br>
</p>

<p>What is included under the term “Literature?” Is
all prose literature?</p>

<p class="right">
H. L. A.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It would be difficult to improve upon
the definition of literature in Webster, quarto
edition: “1. Learning; acquaintance with letters
or books. 2. The collective body of literary productions,
embracing the entire results of knowledge
and fancy preserved in writing; also the
whole body of writing upon a given subject, as
the <em>literature</em> of biblical literature, of chemistry,
etc. 3. Belles-lettres, or the class of writings
distinguished for beauty or style of expression—as
poetry, essays, or history—in distinction from
scientific treatises and works on positive knowledge.”
Which of the above senses is intended
must be judged from the subject and context.
Webster further says: “Literature, in its widest
sense, embraces all compositions, except those on
the positive sciences, mathematics, etc.
It is usually confined, however, to belles-lettres,
or works of taste and sentiment,
as poetry, eloquence, history,
etc., excluding abstract discussions
and mere erudition. A man of <em>literature</em> is one
who is versed in the belles-lettres; a man of
<em>learning</em> excels in what is taught in the schools,
and has a wide extent of knowledge, especially
in respect to the past; a man of <em>erudition</em> is one
who is skilled in the more recondite branches of
learned inquiry.” The perspicuity of the above
definitions leaves nothing obscure. Prose is the
common language of men, in distinction from
verse. All of literature that is not in verse may
be classed as prose, but so may ordinary social
and business correspondence, text-books of
science, court records, State statutes, and city
ordinances, and much else which is plainly excluded
from literature by the definitions given
above.</p>

several years I have seen notices, or sketches, of ‘Old
Grimes,’ generally without age, date, and other items
to identify the real ‘Old Grimes’ as I knew him. Ephraim
Grimes was born about 1770, in Connecticut.”
C. N. H. further states, after giving something of his
history, that he finally “landed at Fort Covington, N.
Y., where he remained, making shingles, until about
1834, when his son came and took him to Connecticut.”</p>

<p>Now, I wish simply to say that I am sure that Ephraim
“Grimes,” born in 1770, and living and making
shingles in 1834, was not, as C. N. H. declares, the real
“Old Grimes” about whom was composed the song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Old Grimes is dead, that good old soul.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">We ne’er shall see him more;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He used to wear a long blue coat</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All buttoned down before.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I heard this old song sung when I was a lad going to
school, about 1825. So that if “Old Grimes” was dead
in 1825 your correspondent is mistaken in stating that
he has seen and known the “real Old Grimes.” Again,
the real “Old Grimes” is said, in the rhyme, to be a
“good old soul;” but C. N. H. states that “Ephraim
Grimes was a dealer in counterfeit money, was convicted,
imprisoned, and had the tip of his right ear
taken off and was banished the State.” Not a very
“good old soul,” was he?</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The article above referred to, as
from “C. N. H.,” was not published in Our Curiosity
Shop. Beyond doubt the subject of the
rhyme quoted was not the Grimes who died in
Connecticut in 1834. The original Grimes was
first immortalized by the English poet Crabbe,
who was born in 1754 and died in 1832. Grimes
was the subject of one of his tales in rhyme.
Later, the American poet Albert G. Greene, of
Rhode Island, wrote the humorous ballad which
has rendered “Old Grimes” familiar to every
American boy and girl.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Lord High Chancellor of Great
Britain is the highest legal authority in the kingdom,
the confidential adviser of the sovereign,
and in rank precedes all except the members of
the royal family and the Archbishop of Canterbury.
He is a political officer, and one of the Cabinet,
the President of the Supreme Court of Judicature,
and also a member of the Privy Council,
a Court of Appeal composed of the Lord Chancellor,
the Judges of the High Court of Justice, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
four other judges. He is created without writ or
patent, by the simple delivery of the great seal, of
which he becomes the keeper, and during his
term of office he acts as prolocutor for the sovereign
in Parliament.</p>

<p>The High Court has five divisions: The Queen’s
Bench—the Supreme Court of Common Law—presided
over by the Lord Chief Justice of England,
assisted by four “puisne justices;” the Chancery,
presided over by the Master of Rolls and three
vice chancellors; the Common Pleas, by the Lord
Chief Justice of Common Pleas, and four “puisne
justices;” the Court of Exchequer, by the Lord
Chief Baron and four “puisne barons;” the Court
for Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty cases, by a
president, judge, and admiralty advocate, Queen’s
proctor, and admiralty proctor.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Not if the paper, magazine, or book
is copyrighted in this country, as most American
illustrated papers, magazines, and books are.
The copyright law is intended to give artists and
publishers exclusive control of their productions.
The right course to take to get the privilege of
using copyrighted works of any kind is to negotiate
with the publishers, who will, in some cases,
make very moderate terms, particularly for the
use of wood-cuts and other engravings that are
several years old. There is no law against pirating
the illustrations published in European periodicals,
and this is done in this country by photo-engraving
and other means, to an unlimited extent.
Last winter an enterprising contemporary
astonished all Chicagoans by loading our newsboys
with illustrations of the still flaming ruins
of the Newhall House, Milwaukee, before noon of
the day of the conflagration. It turned out that
the illustration was a photo-engraving of the ruins

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It would be a rash geologist who

cannot be reckoned by years with any approach
to certainty. Even the dates of geological events
in the “Recent,” or “Human Period,” immediately
following the Glacial Period, cannot be
arithmetically computed. The order of their
succession is about all that can be established
with reasonable certainty. Such events belong,
practically speaking, to an era of which it has
been said: “Then time was not.” In America
evidences of glacial action extend as far south,
at least, as Washington and the Ohio River; in
Europe to 50 degrees north latitude, and in some

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Louis Philippe, son of Louis Philippe
Joseph, Duke of Orleans, was born at Paris in
1773, and, having held the title of Lieutenant
of the Kingdom since the abdication of Charles
X., as a result of the revolution of July, 1830<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
ascended the throne of France Aug. 9, 1830.
During the first revolution, in which he fought
on the side of the people, he became suspected
of aspiring to the throne, and, his arrest having
been ordered, he sought refuge for himself and
sister in Switzerland. There for a time he taught
under the assumed name of Chabaud-Latour.
Later he visited Northern Europe and America,
and in 1800 settled at Twickenham, near London.
Upon the restoration of the royal family, he
returned to Paris, and recovered his estates.
Though coldly received by his suspicious kinsman,
Louis XVIII., he was extremely popular
elsewhere, and in recognition of his plain
manners and attention to the bourgeoisie he
received the title “Citizen King.” His reign was
prosperous, and his wise government did much
to restore France to a state of quiet industry.
But suddenly the cry arose for a reform
in the electoral system, and receiving no friendly
response from the King or ministry, the
people grew rebellious. The King used
military force, the people became their own
army, and Feb. 24, 1848, Louis Philippe fled
from Paris, with his faithful minister, Guizot.
He and his queen were concealed in Normandy
for a few days, and then passed on a British
steamboat to Newhaven, Eng., as Mr. and Mrs.
Smith. He died quietly at Claremont in 1850.</p>

<p>It was stated not long ago, in Our Curiosity Shop,
that the postal expenses in the Southern States have
long exceeded the postal revenue from the same
States, while in the Northern States the opposite is
true. I challenge you to show that this was the case
before the late civil war.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Confederate.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—That is not at all hard to show. It
has been the case pretty much ever since the
government was formed. In the Northern States
the postal revenue has almost always been in excess
of the expenditures, while the reverse has
been true in the South. In 1846-7 the transportation
of the mails throughout New England cost
$256,464, while the postal revenue collected in
those States amounted to $443,648. The expense
of mail transportation in New York and Pennsylvania
was only $384,719, while the postal revenue
collected amounted to nearly double that
amount, say $746,933. In Virginia, Maryland,
the Carolinas, and Georgia, during the same
time, the expenditures aggregated $770,044,
while the amount received for postage was but
$311,569, or less than half as much. At the
same time Alabama paid in less than $50,000,
while the expenditures were over $136,000; and
Texas returned but $3,246 for an expenditure of
$24,102; though Wisconsin, in which the expenditure
reached but $15,043, returned to the general
postoffice $56,703, and Iowa, then in its
infancy, came within less than $500 of meeting
all the cost of her postal service. This is a fair
sample of how it was before the war.</p>

<p class="right">

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—According to the census of 1880 the
four States showing the highest assessed valuation
of real estate and personal property are:
New York, $2,651,940,006; Pennsylvania,
$1,683,459,016; Massachusetts, $1,584,756,802;
Ohio, $1,534,360,508. Assessed valuations are
so far from being the true values of property, and
there is such divergency in the practice of the
various States—some assessing at nearly the true
value, others at scarcely 25 per cent of it, and
most of them at rates ranging between 40 per
cent and 50 per cent of it—that there is no great
amount of satisfaction in a comparison based on
these valuations. For example, the total assessed
valuation of personal property for the State of
New York is $322,657,647, when it is generally
believed that four men, Mr. Vanderbilt, Jay
Gould, Russel Sage, and Augustus Belmont, together,
own very nearly this amount in bonds,
mortgages, and other personal property.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Tipton</span>, Iowa.<br>
</p>

<p>Is it true that a pension attorney cannot lawfully
charge more than $10 for his services in procuring a
pension? If so, when was this law passed? It used to
be $25: at least that was what pensioners around here
paid.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Old Soldier.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Prior to June 20, 1878, it was lawful
for an attorney to make a contract with a pension
claimant for $25 as a fee, which amount was
paid by the Commissioner of Pensions, or on
his order, when the pension was allowed, out of
the first pension payment. It was wholly contingent
upon the successful prosecution of the
claim. In 1878 Mr. Bentley, then Commissioner
of Pensions, arrayed himself against claim attorneys,
and procured the enactment of the present
law, approved June 10, 1878, making it unlawful
for an attorney to receive a greater sum than $10
for his services in procuring a pension. This
amount the attorney can collect from the applicant
and keep, whether the claim is allowed or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
not. It is doubtful whether Mr. Bentley’s well
intended endeavors to benefit applicants through
this law have not resulted in more harm than
good, as hundreds, if not thousands, of applicants
have paid attorneys this $10 in advance, and
therefore the latter, having nothing more to gain,
have merely filed the applications, and left the
cases to take the regular red-tape course, and be
thrown out for informalities or for want of a little
additional testimony, which defects the attorneys
would have strived to cure if the fee had remained
at $25, and been wholly contingent on
the allowance of the pensions.</p>

<p>Please give the composition and properties of “headlight

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Strictly speaking, headlight oil of the
first quality is what its discoverer, Joshua Merrill,
named mineral sperm. It is an illuminating
oil intermediate between kerosene and neutral
lubricating oil, the specific gravity of kerosene
being .804, that of mineral sperm .847,
and that of lubricating oil .883. The boiling
points of these are respectively, 350 deg. Fahr.,
425 deg., and 575 deg. It is volatile only at very
high temperature, therefore, and cannot be ignited
at less than 300 deg. Fahr., which is one
reason why it is preferred to kerosene, particularly
on railroad cars and locomotives and ocean
steamers. The headlight oils in common use do
not conform strictly to the above descriptions,
being, some of them, only a fine quality of kerosene.
The chemical constituents of refined petroleum
are hydrogen and carbon, in the proportions
of 75 of the former to 85 of the latter. We
have not the precise chemical formula for headlight
oil.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The National cemeteries consecrated
to the remains of the fallen patriots of the late
civil war are all well cared for by salaried superintendents,
and are examined from time to time
by competent inspectors, whose duties require
them to report any neglect. Every grave is
marked with a headstone; the grounds are handsomely
laid out; the walks, winding among the
green swarded lots, are neatly graveled; and
shade trees, ornamental shrubs and flower beds
are tastefully arranged to beautify these “God’s
acres,” sacred to the Nation’s dead. The cemeteries
west of the Missouri contain the graves of
a good many soldiers who have died since the
rebellion, in the regular army service on the frontiers.
There is an United States National cemetery
near the City of Mexico, consecrated to the
gallant fellows who fell at Chapultepec, and Contreras,
and in other brilliant actions of the war
with Mexico. The locality of the awful massacre
of General Custer and his entire
command by the Indians, led
by Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, is marked by a
National cemetery and a suitable monument.

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It is not easy to ascertain the rates of
postage between the United States and each of
the States of Europe for the whole period of our
history, nor would the information repay the research.
The Whig Almanac for 1849
gives the following rates of foreign postage
prevailing at that time: Letters, per
half ounce, to Bremen, paid or unpaid,
if mailed at New York, 24 cents; within 300
miles of New York, 29 cents; over 300 miles, 34
cents. If to Prussia, 12 cents additional; to
Hamburg, 6 cents additional; to Austria, 18
cents; Bavaria, 22 cents; Switzerland, 21 cents;
Egypt, 37 cents—each additional, per quarter-ounce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
letter. To Denmark, 22 cents; Sweden,
39 cents; St. Petersburg, Russia, 24 cents—each
additional, per half ounce. To British West India
Islands, by British West India mail steamers,
25 cents per half ounce; to Martinique, Havana,
Porto Rico, St. Thomas, or other islands
not British, 50 cents; to Chagres, Panama, Valparaiso,
or any port on the Pacific coast, 75
cents. The same year the postal difficulties with
Great Britain and her colonies were adjusted by
the adoption of a uniform rate of sea and port
postage not to exceed 24 cents, the inland
rates (5 cents to 10 cents here and 2 cents to 4
cents in Britain) being added. In 1860 the following
foreign postal rates prevailed for one-half
ounce; to France and Algeria, by French mails,
30 cents; to the German states, 30 cents; to
Great Britain, 24 cents, except from Washington,
Oregon, and California, (29 cents); to Bremen, 10
cents; to Hamburg, 10 cents; to Frankfort or
Wurtemburg, 22 cents; to Luxemburg, 25 cents;
to Holland and the Netherlands, 42 cents; to Austria,
30 cents; to Russia, 29 cents; to Prussia, 30
cents; to the Papal States and Tuscany, 35 cents;
to Spain, 42 cents; to Portugal, 42 cents; to Denmark,
35 cents; to Sweden, 42 cents; to Norway,
46 cents; to the West India Islands, (not British)
34 cents for less than 2,500 miles, and 44 cents
for more than 2,500 miles: to the
British West India Islands, 10 cents for
2,500 miles or less, and 20 cents for
any greater distance; to the two Sicilies, 30
cents; to Parma and Modena, 33 cents; to Lombardy,
33 cents; to the Sardinian States, 38 cents.
In 1865 the postage was about the same; but
after the formation of the postal union, in 1874,
an uniform postage was adopted of 5 cents on
prepaid, and 10 cents on unpaid letters, weighing
not more than one-half ounce, between all members
of the union; newspapers not exceeding 4
ounces, 2 cents; books and all other printed matter
and patterns of merchandise, not exceeding
8¾ ounces, at the rate of 2 cents per 2 ounces;
postal cards, 2 cents.</p>

<p>In a recent political dispute the free-trader declared
that the consumer pays all the tariff. How can the
protectionist answer this?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Inquirer.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—This question has been answered,
substantially, several times before, but the following
extract from the speech made before the
Fair Trade Congress, Leamington, by Robert P.
Porter, formerly editor of Our Curiosity Shop,
author of “The West in 1880,” and member of
the late United States Tariff Commission, is so
much in point that it is given here:</p>

<p>“In the cotton industry need I say that we have
practically robbed England of 50,000,000 of customers,
increased the number employed in our
mills to 200,000 persons, and, in the last two
decades, doubled the value of the product. Imports
of cotton goods have steadily declined from
227,000,000 yards in 1860 to 23,000,000 yards
in 1881, while exports reached the same year
150,000,000 yards. Has the consumer been injured?
No! With the exception of a few special
lines which we do not manufacture, cotton goods
are as cheap, and even cheaper, with us than in
England. A more remarkable progress has been
made in the silk industry, which before the
Morrill tariff gave employment to 5,000 persons;
in 1880 it employed over 30,000, a six-fold
increase. The importation of silk
goods has remained stationary since
1860 at about £6,000,000, the production of our
own mills increasing from £1,200,000 in 1860
to over £8,000,000 in 1880. Yet the cost of the
manufactured goods to the consumer, estimated
on a gold basis, has steadily declined at a much
greater rate than the cost of the raw material.”</p>

<p>Further on Mr. Potter says: “I have this year
made a careful comparison of the average earnings
of labor in the important branches of industry
in Great Britain, Germany, France, Belgium,
and Holland, with the average earnings of
the same class of workers in the United States.
In prosecuting this inquiry I have visited the industrial
centers of these countries, and am prepared
to further substantiate my conclusions
with details if necessary. I find that in the
United States wages are from 60 to 150 per cent
higher in the various industrial pursuits than
they are in the mentioned European countries.
At the same time the difference between the purchasing
power of a dollar in free trade and protection
countries is absurdly exaggerated by the
Cobden Clubites. In Germany and France (under
protective tariffs), especially in the former
country, the workmen can live far cheaper than
in England. The purchasing power of a dollar,
so far as the wants of the working man is concerned,
when the cost and quality of food is
taken into consideration, is about the same in the
United States as in England, though wages are
often 100 per cent higher in America.”</p>

francs for household expenses. 2. Helen, according
to tradition, was the daughter of Zeus
and Leda, the wife of Tyndareus, King
of Sparta, and was so extremely beautiful that at
the age of 10 she was stolen by two mighty
Greeks, from whom her brothers, Castor and Pollux,
rescued her. Later Tyndareus bound her
suitors to the number of about thirty to save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
her, in case of another abduction. She became
the wife of Menelaus, King of Lacedæmon, but,
during his absence from home, Paris, a prince
from Troy, in Asia Minor, induced her to elope
with him. Thereupon Menelaus called upon the
thirty to fulfill their oath, and with a large army
they sailed against Troy, laid siege to it, and were
victorious after ten years. There are conflicting
stories of her fate.</p>

<p>Certainly, in the case of Ohio, the aggregate
yield of even years surpassed that of the odd
years, and the same was true in all but one pair
of years for Nebraska. As regards the average
yield per acre, the even years were not so uniformly
better than the odd ones, and this is the
only test measure. But the following table, from
the same source, showing the average yield of
wheat per acre for the whole United States,
for the ten years from 1872 to 1881 inclusive, is
calculated to explode the notion that the oddness

<p>One of the most interesting facts to note in the
above table is the rapid increase of wheat raising
in Ohio, which is due in large degree to the improved
methods in farming—deep plowing, use
of fertilizers, tile drainage, and so forth. Another
matter worthy of special notice is the large increase
of the Nebraska wheat crop, owing to the
steady extension of the cultivated area of that
State. The falling off in the average yield per
acre points to the lesson that Nebraska must
learn from the example of Ohio—the necessity for
improved cultivation as the country grows older.</p>

How long did it ever hold unbroken control of the

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">W. N. Gales.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The birth of the Democratic party,
or “Jacksonian Democracy,” as it used to be
called, dates from the disruption of the old Democratic-Republican
party, consequent upon the
election of John Quincy Adams as President
Soon after the Inauguration of Adams in 1825
the Adams and Clay factions of the Democratic-Republican
party separated from it. The Jackson
and Calhoun factions rallied around these
men, and the Presidential election contest of
1828 was fought on almost purely personal issues.
Jackson was elected President over Adams
by 178 electoral votes to 83, although the popular
vote stood 647,231 for Jackson and 509,097
for Adams. At the same time Calhoun was
elected Vice President by 171 electoral votes
to 83 for Richard Rush, of Pennsylvania.
Before the next Presidential canvass Jackson and
Calhoun had become inimical to each other; the
“Jackson men” carried the day, and, through the
<em>first</em> National Democratic Convention—held in
Baltimore in May, 1832—nominated Jackson for
re-election, and Van Buren in place of Calhoun for
Vice President. Dating from Jackson’s first term,
the Democrats held unbroken control of the
Executive office until the end of Van Buren’s
term, in all twelve years, which is the longest
period of consecutive Democratic administration
of our Federal Government. The next longest
was from March 4, 1853, to the bankruptcy of
the National Treasury and the civil war, reached
before its close, eight years later.</p>

<p>I was born in Chicago, Oct. 1, 1827, and my elder

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Levi Reed.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The first white child born in Chicago
was a girl, Ellen Marion Kinzie, sister of the
late Colonel John H. Kinzie. According to the
testimony of Mrs. Whistler, wife of Lieut. William
Whistler, this was in December, 1804. Mrs.
Whistler was the mother of the first white boy
born in Chicago, Merriweather Lewis Whistler.
He first saluted the light in old Fort Dearborn in
the autumn of 1805. He was drowned at the
age of 7, at Newport, Ky. Your brother is certainly
mistaken as to the number of houses in
Chicago in 1827, for a series of reminiscences dictated
by the early pioneer, John H. Fonda, quoted
in Hurlburt’s “Chicago Antiquities,” says that
when Fonda visited Chicago in 1825, though it
was then but an Indian agency and trading post,
the place contained “about fourteen houses.”</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">John Cowan.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—At one time artichokes were supposed
to be very watery and injurious food for swine,
but a careful analysis has proved that they are
not less nutritious than potatoes. In the Western
States they grow wild in great quantities, and
the roots are greedily devoured by the hogs. The
Brazil variety should be extensively cultivated in
a well-drained soil, as it is hardy and easily
raised. The American Encyclopedia of Agriculture
gives the following instructions for cultivating
them: “Furrow the ground four feet apart
and plant the tubers an inch below the surface
and about ten inches apart, covering about two
inches. Keep free from weeds with the ordinary
two-horse corn-cultivator. Dig in the fall and
leave the tubers to be rooted out by the hogs in
autumn, winter, and spring. They bear great
heat and drought, and are excellent food for
horses, cows and sheep in winter if used in connection
with food and salt.</p>

States army, as given in the report of the Chief
of Ordnance to the Secretary of War, for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1880, was as follows: Total
non-commissioned officers, musicians, and
privates, 117,037. Add 145 general officers, 921
general staff officers, 1,605 regimental field and

</p>

<p>Give your Iowa readers a few facts as to the navigation
of the Mississippi River. About what proportion
of the time is it closed by ice or on account of low
water?</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Averaged for the nine years from
1865 to 1873, the depth of water below St. Louis
was eight feet or over for about one-half the year,
and less than four feet not quite three and one-half
days a year. The time that navigation was
arrested by ice in the ten seasons from 1870 to
1880 averaged thirty-five days a year; and the
time that barges could not be loaded to eight
feet draft on account of low water or ice, during
the seven years ending with 1880, averaged about
one hundred and twenty-six days a year. In the
canals around the Mississippi rapids and between
the Mississippi and the lakes, navigation is suspended
above five months each year. To appreciate
the significance of the above figures as to
depth of water, it must be borne in mind that,
where the depth of water is eight feet and over,
grain is transported at less than half what it costs
when the depth is four feet. There are years
when navigation below St. Louis is not obstructed
by ice all winter through; as for example, in the
winters of 1868-69, 1873-74, 1875-76, while in
the rigorous winter of 1877-78 the river was
closed at St. Louis seventy days. Between St.
Louis and Quincy navigation is obstructed by ice
about four months every year, and by low water
about thirty-five days more, while between
Quincy and St. Paul navigation is practically
closed about half of every year either on account
of ice or low water.</p>

<p>What is the object of the poultry association, formed
in Ohio some time ago? Is it merely for speculative

are the officers and who can become members?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Poultry Raiser.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Probably the organization referred to
in the above question is what calls itself the
North American Poultry Association. Its declared
purpose is “to take united action in the
extension of the business of producing poultry
and eggs for market, and for the mutual protection
and advancement of the interests of producers.”
This it proposes to do by showing people
that “poultry-raising is more profitable than
any other branch of stock-raising;” by keeping
its members informed as to the best markets for
poultry and eggs at different seasons of the year;
by uniting to get the lowest shipping rates; by
efforts to protect each other from dishonest
poultry dealers or commission men; by imparting
to one another useful information as to
cures for diseases of fowls, and improvements
in feeding and taking care of them.
Whether some of the principal members are using
this organization for selfish purposes to any reprehensible
degree, as has been charged by one or
more correspondents, we are not prepared to affirm
or deny. Some of them are engaged in raising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
and selling fancy fowls and eggs at high
prices, but as that is one of the declared objects
of the association, it may only prove that it is
fulfilling its mission. Any one in any part of the
United States or Canada who wishes to become a
member is invited to send $2 to the Treasurer,
with a request that his name be presented to the
association for admission to membership, the
money to be returned in case he is not elected.
In the opinion of some correspondents, the reason
for demanding this prepayment is very obscure.
Hoping to obtain official enlightenment as to the
character of this association, <span class="smcap">The Inter Ocean</span>
addressed an inquiry to W. L. Chamberlain, Secretary
of the Ohio State Board of Agriculture, to
which he returned the following reply, which

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The southeast corner-stone of the
Capitol was laid Sept. 18, 1793, “by Brother
George Washington, assisted by the Worshipful
Masters and Free Masons of the surrounding
cities, the military, and a large number of people.”
The north wing was ready for occupancy
in 1800, the south wing in 1808; but both
were partially destroyed by the British in 1811.
The foundation of the main building was laid in
1818 (March 24), the restoration of the wings
having been commenced three years earlier; and
the whole was completed in 1827. July 4, 1851,
the corner-stone of the south extension was laid
by President Fillmore, and this was finished in
1857. The north extension was occupied by the
Senate in 1859. The present dome, commenced
in 1855, was completed eight years later, and
Dec. 12, 1863, the American flag floated from its
summit. Thus far the cost of the entire building
has been $13,000,000—main building, $3,000,000;
dome, $1,000,000; extensions, $8,000,000;
miscellaneous items, $1,000,000. The length of
the entire building is 751 feet 4 inches; its
greatest breadth, 324 feet; and it covers a little
over 3½ acres. The distance from the ground to
the top of the dome is 307½ feet; the diameter of

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It is not telegraph companies, but
express companies that do such business. One
of the leading express companies will send
money from any one of its important city or
village agencies to another at the following rates,
in addition to the cost of telegraph service: For
sums of $100 or less, 1 per cent; for sums between

company will purchase goods for family consumption,
without extra charges; and will advance
the money for orders not exceeding $5
each, provided deposit is made with the agent at
the office from which order is sent. Similar accommodation
is provided for by other express

owing to the Presidential election of that year

By the 31st of December most of the remainder
had been taken by banks and bankers upon certain

passed March 2, authorized a loan of $10,000,000,
and restored the highest protective character
to the tariff. During the Mexican war, in
1847, the government made loans to the amount
of $9,415,250 at 6 per cent interest.</p>

<p>I remember reading, when a boy, in a Baltimore

gallery of Vauxhall Garden, London, and I think it
stated also “with a loss of all the valuable paintings.”
Please state in what year that conflagration occurred,
Any information regarding this garden would be of

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Vauxhall Garden, named from its
site in “La Salle Faukes,” was first opened to the
public in 1660, and was for nearly two centuries
the favorite resort for a large class of London
pleasure-seekers. It was laid out with beautiful
walks, fountains, booths, and buildings, and was
nightly thronged by a gay and brilliant company,
eating and drinking, while they gossiped or
made love to the sound of constant music. But
toward the latter part of the eighteenth century
the garden fell into disrepute, through the increasing
laxity of many of its patrons, and on
July 25, 1859, the garden was forever closed, its
site being soon covered with streets and buildings.
We cannot find the date of the fire you
mention. It is consoling, however, to know that
few, if any, of the paintings had great merit. A
vivid description of Vauxhall is given in Thackeray’s
“Vanity Fair.”</p>

<p>A friend asserts that the cost of the United States

not much more than half that amount. What does
Our Curiosity Shop say?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">John Allen.</span><br>

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—It says that you are nearer right than
your friend. It is likely that he gets his notion
from noting the total expenditures for the “military
establishment” as given in Secretary Folger’s
report a few days ago, amounting to $48,911,382.93.
Let him look at the items and he will
see such ones as this, “Improving rivers and
harbors,” $13,639,381.27 included under
the above head. Owing to the important
bearing of the transportation
question and the condition of our harbors upon
the subject of National defense; in deference to
the State rights advocates of early times; and
also because of the prevailing confidence in the
ability of the engineer corps of the United States
army, the appropriations made by Congress for
the improvement of the National water-ways
have, as a rule, been expended under the direction
of army engineers. Below are given all the items
that enter into the grand total of nearly fifty
millions which your friend erroneously charges
up as the annual cost of the United States army.
This is a statement for the fiscal year closing

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Hastings</span>, Neb.<br>
</p>

<p>Give us a rule, if there is any, for calculating the
weight of cattle by measuring them.</p>

<p class="right">
A. C.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—No rule will lead to anything more
than an approximation to the actual weight. Every
stock-raiser should have his own scales. The
following is as good a rule as any for estimating
the weight of animals by measure: Multiply the
girth in inches, taken immediately behind the
shoulder blade, by the length in inches from the
square of the buttock to the point of the shoulder
blade, and divide the product by 144, which
gives the number of superficial feet. If the animal
has a girth of 3 to 5 feet, multiply the number
of superficial feet by 16, and you will have
its approximate weight. If the girth is 5 to 7
feet multiply by 23, and if 7 to 9 feet multiply by
31. If less than 3 feet girth, as in the cases of
small calves, hogs, sheep, etc., multiply by 11.
Allowance must be made for the build of the animal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
conditions of fattening, etc. The above
rule is for grass-fed cattle; it being estimated
that in the cases of grass-fatted sheep, calves,
and kine, or steers, each superficial foot,
when the girth is 3 feet or under, represents a
weight of 11 pounds; when 3 to 5 feet, 16
pounds; when 5 to 7 feet, 23 pounds, and when
7 to 9 feet, 31 pounds. Thus an ox measuring
eight feet girth and seven and a half feet in
length should weigh about 8x7½x31 pounds, or,
say 1,860 pounds. Under this rule it is customary
to deduct one-twentieth of the whole for
half-fatted cattle; from 15 to 20 pounds on a
cow having had calves, and if not fat an equal
amount.</p>

<p>What is the cause of smut in wheat, and what is a
sure preventive?</p>

<p class="right">
G. F.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Smut is a fungus with very minute
spores, that feeds upon the grain, replacing or
destroying the organs upon which it feeds. The
best preventive used is a pound of blue vitriol in
two gallons of water. But it is not enough to
sprinkle this over the wheat. Put the grain into
enough of the solution to cover it, and stir slowly
to allow the light material to rise. Skim,
and at the end of an hour spread
the wheat on a dry floor, and
sprinkle it with quick-lime, previously so slacked
with chamber lye as to leave the lime in powder.
So continue until you have all the wheat treated.
In this state it may be heaped, and remain several
days before sowing, if the heap be occasionally
turned. If the wheat remains damp, it must
be still further dried, so it will pass easily from
the drill, if it is to be drilled. The above plan is
recommended by the “American Encyclopedia of
Agriculture” as the only certain preventive. Yet
even this may fail sometimes.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">FIRST REVOLVING TURRET.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lacon</span>, Ill.—Reading an article in Our Curiosity
Shop some time ago set me to thinking of some
papers of my former husband, H. G. Hamlin,
showing that in 1842 he and a Mr. Nathan I.
Styles assisted Mr. Theodore L. Timby, who
afterward secured the first patent for a turret-ship,
to build a model. After much consulting
and experimenting, in 1843 they changed their
plan and built a working model called a “revolving
battery for offensive and defensive warfare on
land and sea,” expense not to exceed $1,800. It
was finished in June, 1843. The said model
consisted of a circular icon tower, about
five feet high and eight feet in diameter,
with three decks, and pierced on each
deck for thirty-five guns, with two perfect engines
worked by steam to cause the said tower to revolve.
The cost when finished was $2,230. Said
model was built in Syracuse, N. Y., and I saw it
on exhibition. I will here copy a letter from F. E.
Spinner (I cannot copy his signature):</p>

<p>“It is found on inquiry at the Navy Department
that the government pays no one for the use of
the patent for the revolving turret. It seems that
the company with which Mr. Ericsson is connected
has paid a Mr. Timby $100,000 for the
use of the patent, and Mr. Hamlin and Styles
never received $1.”</p>

<p>After knowing this, Mr. Hamlin applied to
Timby for his share; he denied that Mr. H. ever
had any interest in it. This was in 1863. He
had the papers all made out for his claim, but
was taken with congestion of the lungs, and died
in a few days.</p>

<p>I heard Mr. Timby say that he conceived the
idea when he was only 18 years of age. I don’t
like the way he treated his partners, but I like to
give credit where credit is due. Mr. Ericsson deserves
much of his country for his energy and
perseverance in making the application when he
did.</p>

<p>Please excuse all blunders, as I am an old
woman, almost 74 years of age, and this is the
first time I ever wrote to an editor. My present
husband is nearly 81. We intend to read <span class="smcap">The

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—There are some remarkable ruins
about four miles southeast of Magdalena, Mexico,
in the State of Sonora, which have of late attracted
a good deal of notice. There is among
these one pyramid, with a base of 4,320 feet
square and an elevation of 750 feet. It has a
winding roadway, leading by an easy grade from
bottom to top, wide enough for carriages. This
is several miles long. In the sides of this
mountain, as one ascends, he passes hundreds of
chambers cut in the solid rock, with walls, floor,
and ceiling hewn to an even precision truly remarkable.
These chambers vary in size from
five to ten, sixteen, and even eighteen feet
square. There are no windows and but one entrance,
which is always from the top. The
height of the ceiling, usually, is eight feet. The
walls are covered in places with hieroglyphics
and figures of men and animals. In some places
feet and hands of human beings are found cut in
the rock. Who constructed these dwellings is
not now certainly known. Some claim that they
were the ancestors of the ancient Aztecs or Toltecs.
It is not improbable that they are the remains
of ancient Zuni tribes.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">MAINE LIQUOR LAW.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Mt. Ayr</span>, Iowa.<br>
</p>

<p>Please tell us what the Maine liquor law is, and
its effects. Are the Prohibitionists generally satisfied
with the law?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">M. J. Donahoe.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The “Maine law,” briefly stated, is
this: The sale of all intoxicating liquors shall be
controlled exclusively by a special agent, appointed
by the State; and he shall
superintend their lawful sale for medicinal,
mechanical, and manufacturing purposes.
All other persons are prohibited
from selling any liquors, except unadulterated
cider and wine, and from manufacturing for unlawful
sale. The authorized commissioner, violating
the law, shall be fined not less than $30,
and imprisoned for not more than three months.
A common seller shall be fined not less than $100
nor more than $250, with imprisonment for from
three to four months. Any one receiving injury
from an intoxicated person may sue the one who
sold the liquor. The lessee or owner of the saloon
is also liable. As to the effect of the law, we quote
from the address of Governor Dingley to the
Legislature, in 1875: “The statistics (in the
Attorney General’s report) show that during the
past year, in the Supreme Court alone, there have
been 276 convictions, 41 commitments to jail,
and $30,898 collected in fines under these laws—more
of each than in any other year, and
four times as many convictions and ten
times as many fines as in 1866, when the
general enforcement of these laws was resumed
after the close of the war. It is significant, also,
that during these nine or ten years of gradually
increasing efficiency in the enforcement of the laws
against dram-shops, the number of convicts in
the State Prison has fallen off more than one-fourth.”
Governor Sidney Perham, in his message
to the Legislature in 1872, says; “The present
law, when it is enforced, is, so far as I can
judge, as effective in the suppression of the traffic
as are other criminal laws against the crimes
they are intended to prevent.” And Governor
Chamberlain, in his message of 1870, said; “The
laws against intoxicating liquors are as well executed
and obeyed as the laws against profanity,
unchastity, and murder.” These are a few of the
testimonies given to the efficiency of the Maine
law. As a rule prohibitionists are satisfied with
the efficiency, but not the sufficiency, of the legislation.
Still the cause of temperance has been
greatly aided by the Maine legislation, and the
progress has probably been as great as could be
expected.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">GREAT SALT LAKE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Fredonia</span>, N. Y.<br>
</p>

<p>What is the extent of Great Salt Lake? Has it any
outlet? Are the waters salt enough to make good salt?
Is Salt Lake City on the margin of the lake, or some
distance off? Is it navigable?</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Great Salt Lake is a remarkable body
of water, in some respects the most remarkable
in the world. Like the Dead Sea and the Aral
Sea, in Asia, it has no outlet. Its extent
is given variously by different authors.
One explanation of this may be
the generally conceded fact that the
rainfall of the region between the Rocky Mountains
and the Sierra Nevada is increasing, and
the average level of Salt Lake seems to be steadily
rising, so whereas one authority states the
length of the lake as about ninety miles and the
breadth as from twenty to thirty-five miles, another
says it is seventy miles long and forty-five
broad. One says its area is about 3,200 square
miles, and another says it is between 3,000 and
4,000 square miles. One says it is about 4,200
feet above sea level, while another says it is 4,250
feet above, and still rising, and a still later statement

about twenty feet. Its maximum depth is variously
given at sixty feet and seventy-eight feet.
It contains numerous rocky islands, the longest
of which, Antelope, is fifteen miles long. Some
of these islands are used as sheep pastures. The
Bear, the Weber, and the Jordan rivers empty
into this lake, and are for the most part absorbed
by the sandy plain or evaporated by the
dry air of the Great Fremont Basin.
Only the Bear River is navigable, and
that near its mouth. A line of steamers plies between
Corinne, on the north shore, and Black
Rock, on the south. Its waters contain about 20
per cent of common salt; some salt is manufactured
from this natural brine, and there is no
doubt that in time this industry will develop
here into great importance. Unlike the Dead
Sea, this lake abounds with animal life, insects,
shrimps, etc., but not, like the Aral Sea, with
fish. The United States Fish Commission has
undertaken the experiment of stocking it with
certain salt-water fish, and with some prospect of
success. Salt Lake City is about eleven miles
from the lake in a straight line, and fifteen miles
by the traveled road.</p>

<p>An Indian-hater in this neighborhood asserts very
positively that the attempts made to educate the Indians
are all time and money thrown away. What
figures can you give us to disprove this assertion?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The last report of the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs furnishes proof positive that
“Indian-hater” is either utterly unprepared to
make assertions on this subject, or wilfully misrepresents
the facts. Last year there were 5,113
Indian pupils being taught at boarding-schools,
and 5,014 in day-schools. There are seventy-eight
boarding-schools upon Indian reservations,
having in all 4,396 pupils, and in these industrial
training has been carried on so successfully
that the pupils have cultivated 1,526 acres, raising
18,334 bushels of corn, 4,952 bushels of
oats, 19,340 bushels of vegetables, and have
made 1,171 tons of hay, and 4,325 pounds of
butter. Of the boarding pupils in schools not on
reservations, 641 have attended the Indian training-schools
at Hampton (109), Carlisle (390),
and Forest Grove (151), and 106 have
been distributed among various white
schools in the States. At Hampton, since
1878, the government has contributed in all
$52,000, and private charity $81,000, or, taking
the existing number of students as the standard
for the five years, $244 per year per student. In
these training schools the industrial and mechanic
arts are kept in the foreground, and the
main object is to inspire the minds of the young
Indians with habits of faithful, continuous work.
During the past year Carlisle, in addition to
much other work, has turned out ten spring
wagons to be sent to Indian agencies, and Carlisle
and Hampton propose to furnish during the
present fiscal year 2,000 pair of shoes, 3,350
dozen articles of tinware, 22 dozen bridles
and halters, and 450 sets of harness.
An effort is made to teach every Indian
girl pupil sewing and housework and the boys
farming and mechanical trades. The various religious
societies have expended $74,689 in aid of
the government work of education strictly, besides
$70,142 expended on their own missionary
work. This is besides $13,278 contributed by
them in aid of Forest Grove and Carlisle training
schools, the $26,668 in aid of the pupils at
Hampton, $30,504 expended by the societies on
their own seminaries, academies, and missions
among the five civilized tribes, and $24,149 devoted
to schools and missions in Alaska. The
Commissioner pays a high tribute to the value of
this religious aid.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">CHINESE PROVERBS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">LaSalle</span>, Ill.<br>
</p>

<p>I have just read that the Chinese are exceedingly
fond of proverbs, and make great use of them. That
many of these proverbs are full of lofty sentiment and
wisdom. Can the Curiosity Shop give us a few of
them as specimens?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A Regular Reader.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Chinese are indeed remarkably
fond of proverbs. They not only employ them in
conversation—and even to a greater degree than
the Spaniards, who are noted among Europeans
for the number and excellence of their proverbial
sayings—but they have a practice of adorning
their reception rooms with these sententious bits
of wisdom, inscribed on decorated scrolls or embroidered
on rich crapes and brocades. They
carve them on door posts and pillars, and emblazon
them on the walls and ceilings in gilt letters.
In 1875, W. Scarborough published a collection
of 2,720 Chinese proverbs; and these are
but a small part of the great collections to be
found in the “Jeweled Mirror for Illumining the
Mind,” “The Coral Forest of Ancient Matters,”
and other Chinese works. The following are a
few specimens of this sort of literature,
taken from “The Middle Kingdom,”
by S. Wells Williams, for many years
Secretary of the United States Legation at
Peking, and several times de facto United States
Minister. As a sneer at the use of unnecessary
force to crush a contemptible enemy, they say;
“He rides a fierce dog to catch a lame rabbit.”
Similar to this is another, “To use a battle-ax to
cut off a hen’s head.” They say of wicked associates:
“To cherish a bad man is like nourishing
a tiger; if not well fed he will devour you.” Here
are several others mingling wit with wisdom:
“To instigate a villain to do wrong is like teaching
a monkey to climb trees;” “To catch fish and
throw away the net,” which recalls our saying,
“Using the cat’s paw to pull the chestnuts out of
the fire;” “To climb a tree to catch a fish,” is to
talk much to no purpose; “A superficial scholar
is a sheep dressed in a tiger’s skin;” “A cuckoo
in a magpie’s nest,” equivalent to saying, “he is
enjoying another’s labor without compensation;”
“If the blind lead the blind they will both fall
into the pit;” “A fair wind raises no storm;”
“Vast chasms can be filled, but the heart of man
is never satisfied;” “The body may be healed,
but the mind is incurable;” “He seeks the ass, and
lo! he sits upon him;” “He who looks at the sun
is dazzled; he who hears the thunder is deafened,”
i. e., do not come too near the powerful;
“Prevention is better than cure;” “Wine and good
dinners make abundance of friends, but in adversity
not one of them is to be found.” “Let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
every man sweep the snow from before his own
door, and not trouble himself about the frost
on his neighbors’ tiles.” The following one is a
gem of moral wisdom: “Only correct yourself
on the same principle that you correct others;
and excuse others on the same principles on
which you excuse yourself.” “Better not be,
than be nothing.” “One thread does not make
a rope; one swallow does not make a summer.”
“Sensuality is the chief of sins, filial duty the
best of acts.” “The horse’s back is not so safe
as the buffalo’s”—the former is used by the
politician, the latter by the farmer. “Too much
lenity multiplies crime.” “If you love your son
give him plenty of the rod; if you hate him,
cram him with dainties.” “He is my teacher
who tells me my faults, he my enemy who
speaks my virtues.” Having a wholesome dread
of litigation, they say of one who goes to law,
“He sues a flea to catch a bite.” Their
equivalent for our “coming out at the little end
of the horn” is, “The farther the rat creeps up
(or into) the cow’s horn, the narrower it grows.”
The truth of their saying that “The fame of
good deeds does not leave a man’s door, but his
evil acts are known a thousand miles off,” is illustrated
in our own daily papers every morning.
Finally, we close this list with a Chinese proverb
which should be inscribed on the lintel of every
door in Christendom; “The happy hearted man
carries joy for all the household.”</p>

<p class="center no-indent">SHINTUISM—BUDDHISM—CONFUCIANISM.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Castleton</span>, Ill.<br>
</p>

<p>Please give us a statement in the “Curiosity Shop” of
what is known as Shintuism, Buddhism, and Confucianism,
as now existing in China and Japan.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">W. H. Jordan.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Shintuism, Sintuism, Sintoism, or
Sin-syuism, is the prevailing religion of Japan,
the worship of the sun-goddess, Ten-sio-dai-sin.
The descendant and viceregent on earth of this
deity is the Mikado, who is therefore worshiped
as a demi-god. Two ecclesiastical judges, with
monks and priests, complete the hierarchy, and
the latter minister at innumerable shrines and
temples, raised for the worship of the chief deity
and a legion of canonized heroes and benefactors.
In these temples there is no idol visible, but on
the shrine is a mirror, symbolizing purity. Sintuism
requires pre-eminently heart purity and
general temperance, and as aids to these prescribes
pilgrimages to holy places, observance of
holy days, and mortification of the body. Buddhism,
one of the oldest existing religions, traces
its origin 2,460 years back, to Siddhartha, or
Buddha, a Hindoo prince. Its two most prominent
doctrines are the transmigration of the soul
and the cursed condition or total depravity of
human existence in its natural state. The
first teaches that at death every
soul immediately assumes another body,
corresponding in form and habitation
to the previous character of the spirit. If noble,
it may become a divinity, or dwell in some high
place upon the earth, while the wicked wander as
reptiles and vermin, or inhabit the hells in the
interior of the earth. The least term of suffering
is 10,000,000 years, of happiness 10,000,000,000
years. But however long or short, it must
have an end, and the soul enters a new body.
Buddha himself, it is said, has passed through
every form of existence. The second doctrine is
embodied in the “Four Sublime Verities:” Pain
exists; its cause is desire; it may be ended by
Nirvana; the way to Nirvana is a rise through
eight gradations, from simple faith to complete
regeneration. Theoretically this religion has no
priests nor clergy nor public religious rites.
Every man is his own priest and confessor, and
the monks are ascetics only for their own advancement
in holy living; but, in fact, Buddhist
countries swarm with priests, or religious teachers,
so reputed. Confucianism is epitomized in
the following words of the great teacher: “I teach
you nothing but what you might learn yourselves,
viz., the observance of the three fundamental
laws of relation between sovereign and
subject, father and child, husband and wife; and
the five capital virtues—universal charity, impartial
justice, conformity to ceremonies and
established usages, rectitude of heart
and mind, and pure sincerity. Confucius
did not profess to have received any revelation
from “Shan-te”—the Supreme Ruler—or to have
any clear conceptions of Him, although he acknowledged
the existence of such a being, and
taught that His will as learned by studying and
practicing the wisdom of the ancients by the
light of nature, should be implicitly obeyed, as
the only means of living virtuously and happily
and avoiding both in this life and the life to
come the penalties of evil-doing.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Tradition states that Sir Walter

Cobham, gathered a number of his most eminent

what was known as the “Mermaid Club.” “The
Mermaid” was a tavern so situated as to have
three entrances—on Bread, Cheap, and Friday
streets, and was the favorite resort of the leading
actors and literary men in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth; but the Raleigh club was acknowledged
to combine “more talent and genius than
ever met together before or since.” Here Jonson,
Beaumont, Fletcher, Selden, Carew, Donne, and

</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—In reply to this query we received
the following explanation from the editor of the
paper mentioned: Our heading illustrates an
old Scriptural and Masonic legend, that of “Solomon
and the Iron-worker,” otherwise known as
“Tubal Cain.” The scene is the celebration of
the completion of the great temple at Jerusalem.
It has been announced that on this occasion the
one who of all others has been most instrumental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
in the erection of the sacred structure shall be
given the chief seat of honor, and the guests are
horrified to perceive that the lowly blacksmith
has, unobserved, placed himself in it. Loud
murmurs arise, and a movement is made having
for its object his ejectment. Nothing daunted, the
man rises and declares his supremacy over all
the other artificers, in that he wrought all their
tools, and without his work they could have done
nothing. The correctness of his position is thus
proven to the satisfaction of the king, complaints
are silenced, and all honor accorded the
humble smith. The dignity of labor, however
unpretending, is thus demonstrated. The Rabbinical
legend of which we have here traced a
sketch, is full of beauty in its entirety, giving in
detail the challenge of the assembled guests, the
defense of the man, and the speech of the king.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The State Normal School of Nebraska
is located at Peru, near the Missouri River, about
fifty miles north of the Kansas line. This is a
town of 567 inhabitants, according to the census,
accessible only by a branch of the Burlington and
Missouri Railroad. It secured the location of the
school by a donation of site and other inducements
at a time when the population
of the State was only about 100,000.
It graduated its first class, consisting
of two members, in 1870. The total number
of graduates to date is 73. Total enrollment
last year, 318—the largest number in the history
of the school. The normal endowment fund, in
notes and bonds, aggregated $16,308.35 last
year, and the income from all sources in 1881
amounted to $2,423.58. The total appropriation
asked of the last Legislature, was as follows,

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The great apostle of Unitarianism,
as he has been called, was born at Newport, R.
I., April 7, 1780, and in his 15th year entered
Harvard University. In 1798, on his graduation
day, he delivered an oration that captivated
the whole audience, and foretold his future fame
as an orator and writer. While teaching in Richmond,
Va., he became impressed with the evils of
slavery, and deemed the surest cure for all such
abuses to be the spread of Christianity. Returning
to Harvard, he began his theological studies,
acting at the same time as regent of the university.
In 1803 he assumed the pastorate of Federal
Street Church, Boston, and at once became
known as an eloquent and brilliant orator, as
well as an efficient minister. His finest oration,
perhaps, is the one delivered upon the fall of Napoleon,
in 1814, and entitled “The Goodness of
God in Delivering the Christian World from Military
Despotism.” In 1820 he received the title
of Doctor of Divinity from Harvard. Two years
later, while visiting in Europe, he met Coleridge,
who said of him, “He has the love of wisdom and
the wisdom of love.” His “Remarks Upon the
Life and Character of Napoleon Bonaparte,”
which appeared in 1828, did much to spread his
fame throughout the civilized world. His greatest
theological work is, probably, the “Evidences of
Christianity.” An earnest minister of the Unitarian
Church, he was always a sincerely devout
Christian. A friend of the anti-slavery and temperance
movements, when they had but few, his
last public speech was in commemoration of the
abolition of slavery in the British West Indies.
His death occurred in 1842, and his body was

<p><em>Answer.</em>—William Wallace was the youngest
son of a knight of good family in southwestern
Scotland. The place of his birth is uncertain,
but the date was probably about the middle of
the reign of Alexander III. When Edward offered
pardon to the Scottish leaders, after the
subjugation of Scotland and the surrender of
Baliol, Wallace was excepted by name, being ordered
to surrender unconditionally. This he refused
to do, and for many years eluded the search
of those who coveted the handsome price put
upon his head. In 1305, however, he was seized
and carried to London, and there, after a mock
trial, on the 23d of August, he was hanged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
drawn, and quartered, as a traitor. But his cause
lived, and a year later Robert Bruce was crowned

<p>Will you be kind enough to give your readers a description
of California—the climate and resources of
the different parts of the State, and the price of land
to each; what places are best adapted to fruit trees,
and what fruits grow there, and the amount of teachers’
wages?</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Henry Johnson.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The State of California is divided
into three entirely distinct sections: the coast region,
the valleys of the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers, and the deserts. Owing to the
irregularity of the surface, only about one-third
of the State is arable, and in northern California
the crops are wholly dependent upon the rainfall.
In the southern part of the State the land is irrigated
by numerous streams. The chief products
of California are wheat, barley, fruit, timber, and
gold; the raising of cattle and sheep is also profitable
business. The coast region is fertile and
beautiful, abounding in vineyards and orchards.
The climate, varying from 51 degrees to 75 degrees
in summer, and in winter seldom colder
than 15 degrees, is well suited to the cultivation
of such fruits as apples, peaches, pears, oranges,
lemons, almonds, olives, and figs. In this region
also, is the great gold belt, most of the mines being
on the western slope of the Sierra Nevadas.
All of the gold, however, is not found here, as the
earliest mining was on the southeastern slope,
and the precious metal is distributed over the
most of the State. The valleys of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin Rivers occupy the country between
the coast range and the Sierras. This
fertile region is devoted to farming and grazing,
and produces more barley than is raised in any
other State, while its wheat harvests increased
133 per cent from 1860 to 1870. Here, during
the rainy season, the mercury falls to 45 deg.,
and seldom rises higher than 85 deg. In the
Colorado desert the difference between the mean
temperature of January and July is greater,
being some 45 deg., while the mean annual
temperature ranges from 68 to 75 deg. Little
land here is arable, owing to the lack of irrigation.
California has an excellent public school
system, closely resembling that of Massachusetts.
In 1880 the average monthly pay of male teachers
was $79.50; of female teachers, $64.73. Land
in California is by no means cheap. The fruit
lands are scarce, and for the most part in the
hands of private individuals; when well cultivated
and irrigated they sell for $150 to $300
per acre. Grain lands in Northern and North

though some at a great distance from railroads

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The man who has become so famous
was Jonathan Walker, captain of a small vessel
off the Florida coast. He was born at Harwich,
Mass., March 22, 1799, and died at Lake Harbor,
Mich., April 20, 1878. June 23, 1844, though
quite ill, and daily expecting death, he attempted
to carry seven slaves to Nassau, in the British
island, New Providence; but, when only a short
distance out, he was challenged by the sloop
Catharine, and taken back to Key West. There
he was brought before a justice of the peace, and
committed first to jail, and afterward to the
filthy hold of a steamboat that carried him to
Pensacola, where a new trial awaited him. This
time, when he was imprisoned, a chain of half-inch
iron secured him to a huge ring bolt, being
fastened at the other end to a shackle around his
ankle that weighed half a ton. Owing to his
feeble health his sufferings were excruciating,
but his further sentence read thus;
“One hour in the pillory, pelted with unmerchantable
eggs; one year in prison for each slave—seven
in all; $600 for each slave, and all the costs; and
to be branded on the right hand with a large S,
by a redhot branding-iron.” But he bore his
tortures without flinching, and lived to be restored
to his family after much unjust litigation.
We do not know who may have officiated at the
branding; but Ebenezer Dorr, of Maine, was at
that time the United States Marshal for that district.
A beautiful monument to the memory of
Captain Walker has been erected in Muskegon,
Mich.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Perhaps it is safe to say, with the
editor of the “People’s Cyclopedia,” that it is the
remarkable rock-cut temples at Ipsambul of
Abousambul, in Nubia, on the left bank of the
Nile. The largest temple contains fourteen apartments
hewn out of the solid rock. The first and
largest of these is 57 feet long and 52 feet broad,
and is supported by two rows of massive square
pillars, four in each row, and 30 feet high. To
each of these pillars is attached a standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
colossus, or human figure, of enormous proportions,
reaching to the roof, overlaid with a kind
of stucco and painted with gaudy colors, apparently
as brilliant now, after the lapse of over 4,000
years, as when first laid on. In front of this temple
are seated four still larger human figures, two
of them being 65 feet in height—presumed to represent
Rameses the Great, more frequently termed
Sesostris, whose marvelous military exploits are
depicted in drawings and paintings on the temple
walls.</p>

of spirits produced and deposited in distillery

1883, is less than the production of 1882 by
31,839,853 gallons, and of 1881 by 43,741,842

<p><em>Answer.</em>—Taking the world at large there are
many hundreds of societies for the promotion of
science, literature, or the arts. It is not worth
while to enumerate more than a few of those in
foreign countries. In France they have the famous
Institute of France, with its four academies,
viz: The French Academy, the Academy of
Inscriptions and Belles Lettres, the Academy of
Sciences, the Academy of Fine Arts. There is
the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin; the
Academy of Science at Manheim; the Electoral
Bavarian Academy of Sciences at Munich; the
Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg;
the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm; the
Royal Academy of Sciences at Copenhagen; the
Royal Academy of Sciences at Amsterdam; the
Academy of Sciences at Madrid; the de Screti. or
Academia Secretorum Naturæ, at Naples; the
Royal Academy of Sciences at Turin; the Academy
of Sciences at Lisbon; the Royal Academy,
London; and the Royal Irish Academy. Then
there are academies for the advancement of literature
in nearly all European countries. There
were no fewer than 171 of these in Italy alone as
early as the sixteenth century, many of which
still exist. Then there are many academies of
archæology and history, such as the Academy
of Herculaneum, Italy; the Academy
of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres, constituting
one of the four academies of the Institute of
France, as above shown; the Celtic Academy, and
others. There are academies of medicine and
surgery in various parts of the old world. As to
painting, sculpture, and music, they have such
powerful auxiliary societies as the Royal Academy
of Arts, the Royal Academy of Music, and
the Academy of Ancient Music, in London; the
Academy of Painting and Sculpture and the Royal
Academy of Music, in Paris; and similar academies
at Rome, Turin, Madrid, Berlin, Munich,
and elsewhere. There are geographical societies
at all the principal capitals of Europe. Of these
the most conspicuous are the Royal Geographical
Society, London, the Geographical Society of
France, Paris, the Geographical Society of Berlin,
and the Royal Asiatic Society, London, with
branches at Calcutta and Shanghai.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—The Hon. William Ewart Gladstone
was born of Scottish parents in Liverpool, Dec.
29, 1809. He received a thorough education at
Eton and Oxford, graduating from both with the
highest honors. In 1832 he entered politics, being
returned for Newark. He early joined himself
with the Conservative party, under the leadership
of Robert Peel, in which his abilities were
soon recognized by that distinguished statesman,
who gave him the position of Junior Lord of the
Treasury in 1834, and in the following year made
him Under Secretary of State; but with Peel’s
retirement he relinquished that office, in 1841,
when Peel again became Premier, Gladstone
served under him as Vice President, and afterward
as President of the Board of Trade,
in which capacity he derived much
information concerning the commerce
of the nation. He left the Conservative party in
his support of Peel’s free-trade policy, and again
retired in 1845. In 1859 he became Chancellor
of the Exchequer in Lord Palmerston’s administration,
which office he held to his credit until
1866. Two years afterward he was elevated into
the premiership; but his defeat in 1874 resulted
in the elevation of his great rival, Disraeli. He
then resolved to remain out of politics; but the
policy of Beaconsfield in the Eastern question
called forth his earnest disapprobation, and
again brought him before the people in opposition
to the administration. The year 1880 signalized
his triumph, a triumph which was universally
acknowledged as the result of his own personal
popularity and sterling qualities. Gladstone has
always been recognized as a man of strong
character, who has conscientiously endeavored to
advance the interests of the nation and people.
In oratory he possesses the wonderful faculty of
making statistics eloquent. He quickly perceives
a difficulty, and with wise discernment unravels
it. The past three years have only added honor
to his name, and it is to be hoped that so favorable
a beginning may be the dawn of a fruitful administration,
and that ere long the vexed Irish
question or questions will be solved forever.</p>

<p>The increase of revenue from spirits during the
last fiscal year was $4,495,367.02; from fermented
liquors was $746,695.39: the decrease
from tobacco, $5,287,739.12; and from banks
and bankers, $1,504,463.87. The total decrease
of internal revenue from all sources up to June
30, 1883, was $1,969,928.86. This decrease was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
due mainly to the removal of certain taxes and
the reduction of others effected by the legislation
of the last Congress. The cost of collecting the internal
revenue in the last year above named was
$5,113,734.88. Owing to the recent action of
the President consolidating collection districts,
which dispenses with the services of a number
of collectors, and other curtailments rendered
possible by the legislation of the Republican
Congress of 1881-1883, the estimated cost of
collecting internal revenue during the current
fiscal year is $4,999,190, and from present indications
the actual cost will be considerably less
than this.</p>

<p>Is not the statement recently made that the original
Monitor, which fought the rebel ram Merrimac, is still
afloat a mistake? I am of the impression that she
foundered at sea.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>—You are quite correct. According to
G. V. Fox, at one time Assistant Secretary of the
Navy, “At 1 o’clock a. m., Dec. 31, 1862, Cape
Hatteras bearing N. N. E., distant twenty miles,
this little Monitor—whose fame, ‘following the
sun and keeping company with the hours, had
circled the earth,’ found a resting place at the
bottom of the ocean.”</p>

<p>S. L. Moore, Prior Lake, Minn.—General Sheridan
was married to Miss Irene Anna Rucker, daughter
of General D. H. Rucker, U. S. A., June 3,
1875, by the Rt. Rev. Bishop Foley, of Chicago.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A School Girl, Westville, Ill.—The Russians
held Alaska by the right of Behring’s discovery,
in 1741, and the subsequent settlement of the
territory. In 1799 Paul VIII. granted this land
to the Russo-American Fur Company. The charter
of the corporation was renewed in 1839, but
finally expired in 1863, and in 1867 Alaska was
ceded to the United States for $7,200,000.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Willis Hollings, Albany, Ill.—Greenwich, situated
upon the right bank of the Thames, six
miles southeast of London Bridge, is a favorite
suburb of Londoners, on account of its fine parks
and picturesque views. Its meridian was selected
as the one from which to reckon standard
time because from it navigators generally, the
world over, are in the practice of reckoning time
and longitude.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>G. H. S., McLean, Ill.—Snow-shoes consist of a
flat wooden frame, of lanceolate form, from four
to seven feet long, and from eight to fourteen
inches in width at the broadest part. This frame
is filled with wicker-work or thongs, and furnished
with straps upon the upper side, for the
feet. The sole may be wholly of wood. By the
extreme length and breadth the shoe is prevented
from sinking in the snow.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>S. S. H., Smith Center, Kan.:—“The Little Old
Sod Shanty on the Claim” was composed by Mr.

County Pioneer</cite> in 1878, and refers to a claim
one mile from Smith Center.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>John Stuart, Lyneville, Wis.—The ordinary expenditures
of the United States Government for
the year 1881 amounted to $178,204,146.41.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Constant Reader, Chicago—The first negro
slave owned in Chicago, it is believed, was Black
Jim, the property of John H. Kinzie, brought
here by him in 1804.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A Subscriber, Morris, Ill.—“Johnson’s Universal
Cyclopædia” says that Miles Standish lost his
wife, Rose, during the first winter in America.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Daisy, Emporia, Kan.—The sections of one
mile square are the smallest tracts, the out-boundaries
of which the law requires to be
actually surveyed. The minor subdivisions are
defined by law, and the Surveyors General, in
protracting township plats from the field notes
of sections, designate them in red ink, the lines
connecting being imaginary.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mary Maxwell Call, Fulda, Minn., evidently
agrees substantially with another correspondent,
whose communication on this subject was published
a few days ago, as to the origin of the saying
“All is lovely and the goose hangs high.” She
writes: “It is a corruption of the sentry call, ‘All
is lovely and the goose honks high,’” meaning,
the weather is pleasant and the high flying of the
geese indicates that it will continue so. She
thinks, therefore, that it is not “slang.” Webster,
however, does not recognize “honk” as an English
word in good standing, though we are not sure
but he should do so.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>W. F. Smith, Manning, Iowa.—The steeple of
Trinity Church, New York City, is 284 feet in
height.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>W. H. L., Springfield, Ill.—“Lady’s Day” is the
name given in England to “Annunciation Day,”
which always comes on the 25th of March. In
France it is known as Notre Dame de Mars. This
year it and Easter Sunday corresponded.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>James Wilson, Pontiac, Ill.—Journeymen printers
on Chicago morning dailies are paid 40 cents,
on evening and weekly papers and book work 37
cents per 1,000 ems. Job printers get from $18
a week, the minimum, to $21. The expenses of
living are greater in the city than in the country;
this is one reason why wages should be higher in
the city. Another is that most of the work on a
daily paper must be done at night.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>W. D. Doane, Kokomo, Col.—The government
farms out the seal fur fisheries of Alaska to a
commercial company for a stipulated revenue,
and under strict laws regulating the business.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>C. L. Gilbert, Eau Claire, Wis.—“The Fall of
Jerusalem” was written by Henry Hart Milman,
who lived from 1791 to 1868.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>L. Brock, Oswego, Kan.—Patented articles
must bear notice of some kind that they are patented,
and date of patent.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>S. M. Sinclair, Marshalltown, Iowa.—Homesteaders
and pre-emptors must file their claims in person.
They cannot legally do it by proxy of any
kind.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>James Allen, Chicago—The name of the village
at the mouth of the Mississippi, Balize, is the
Spanish for beacon. A beacon-light has shone
here from early times.</p>

<p>F. P., Amherst, Wis.—The Michigan Central
Railroad was completed to Ypsilanti, Feb. 3,

<p>J. F. Clymer, Silver Lake, Ind.—The total colored

was 6,580,793.</p>

between John C. Heenan and Tom Sayers for
the championship of the prize-ring, Sayers carried
off the belt.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Harry, Creston, Iowa.—Dealings in “futures”
or “puts and calls” are contrary to the laws of
Illinois. These laws have not been strictly put
in force. There is a disposition to do that now.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr. Thompson, Monona, Iowa—There are
about 320 acres inclosed in the Union Stock
Yards, Chicago.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>G. M. Ford, Chicago.—The total imports of the
United States for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1882, amounted to $767,111,964; the total exports
to $799,959,736.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>C. Allen, Rock Island, Ill.—The great earthquake
which destroyed so many lives in the
Island of Scio in 1881 occurred on the 3d of
April. About 4,000 persons perished.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Subscriber, Emmetsburg, Iowa—Chore is a
corruption of the old English noun char or
chare, derived from the verb <em>to char</em> or <em>to chare</em>,
signifying to work by the day, take one’s turn
at doing jobs, instead of working as a regularly
hired servant.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A. Annubehale, Chicago.—None but native
Americans are eligible to the office of President
of the United States; but children of American
citizens residing abroad are legally regarded as
natives of this country so far as this and all
other civil rights are concerned.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>G. W. Carter, Blair, Neb.—The fastest mile recorded
of a running horse was made by Ten
Broeck at Louisville, Ky., May 24, 1877, in
1:39¾. The fastest mile recorded of a trotting
horse was made by Maud S. at Rochester, N. Y.,
Aug. 17, 1881, in 2:10¼.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>J. S. Ewell, Adrian, Ill.—The term “thoroughbred”
means bred to a high point from stock of
good pedigree. It may be applied to any species
of animals, although, owing to the extensive
breeding of horses for speed, there has resulted
what is now a distinct class known as
“thoroughbreds.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Blonde and Brunette, Chicago—The phrase
“Bread is the staff of life” is attributed to Dr.
Jonathan Swift. It is in his “Tale of the Tub.”
It is not a Bible phrase. The original of “Uncle
Tom’s Cabin” is still alive. He has published an
autobiography. He was in Chicago not many
months ago. His name is Rev. Josiah Henson.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Non-voter, Rockford, Ill.—The fact that you
are not a citizen and are, therefore, a non-voter
does not exempt you from payment of poll-tax
in case you do not wish to work out your assessment
on the highways. The public roads are
enjoyed by citizens and aliens alike, and—so are
the taxes for keeping them in proper order.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>C. T. Smith, Braddyville, Iowa—The United
States Government has erected a line of towers
in Illinois on about the meridian of Urbana, and
similar towers in other places, including the one
near South Bend, Ind., for the purpose of effecting
a more accurate survey of the country,
and for other scientific purposes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>D. W. Barlow, Nettleton, Mo.—Honey-dew is a
sweet substance found on the leaves of certain
trees and plants in small drops, like dew. There
are two kinds of honey-dew, one which exudes
from plants, and the other which is deposited
on leaves by an insect called the <em>aphis</em>, or vine-fretter.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>H. M. Eastman, Fourche, D. T.—The oldest
form of religion now extant is the Hebrew religion.
The next oldest, probably, are Parseeism,
or the religion of Zoroaster, and Brahmanism.
All of these have changed materially as regards
ceremonial, but in doctrine they are
essentially consistent with the faith of their
founders.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“306,” Dana, Iowa—General P. H. Sheridan
was at Sedan, by courtesy of the King of Prussia,
at the time of the surrender of Napoleon III.
and Marshal MacMahon’s army. At the opening
of the battle, according to the account of the
correspondent of the New York <cite>Tribune</cite>, written
on the field, “the King, Count Bismarck,
General Von Roon, the War Minister, General
von Moltke, and Generals Sheridan and Forsythe
stood in a group overlooking the principal field
of attack.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Leonard Bauman, Clarence, Iowa—The
most productive salt region of the United States
is the Saginaw salt district, Michigan. The most
famous and productive salt mines in the world
are those of the rock salt region of Wieliczka, in
Gallicia, a province of Polish Austria. Great
chambers have been excavated in the solid salt,
some of them fully 150 feet in height, and of
immense length and breadth. One of these is
fitted up as a chapel dedicated to St. Anthony.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An Engineer, Des Moines, Iowa—The assertion
that State prisons are filled with criminals of
good education is a gross exaggeration. Unhappily,
the laws of all the different States do not
provide for full and carefully kept statistics, but
in all cases where such statistics are kept they
go to show that, as a rule, ignorance is the accompaniment,
if not the foster parent, of crime.
For the most reliable report on this subject
write to the Commissioner of Education, Washington,
D. C., asking for copy of the paper of
Dr. Wickersham, read at a recent session of the
National Teachers’ Association.</p>

<p>Peter Sanborn, Chicago.—Every soldier who,
prior to June 22, 1874, had made a homestead
entry of less than 160 acres, may enter so much
more as, when added to the quantity previously
entered, shall not exceed 160 acres.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>F. V. Noggle, Galien, Mich.—Probably the deepest

<hr class="tb">

<p>C., Muscatine, Iowa—According to the laws of
Iowa, one-third of the estate, real and personal,
of a wife who dies without issue and intestate
goes to her husband as dower, and the rest goes
to her parents or heirs on the parents’ side.</p>

$43,372,336.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A Farmer, Cresco, Iowa.—Trichinæ may sometimes
be seen with the naked eye, appearing as
minute specks. They average in size one-seventy-eighth
of an inch in length and one-thirtieth
in breadth, and it does not require a very powerful
microscope to disclose them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>R. A. Santer, Hitesville, Iowa.—To kill white
willow, cut it close to the ground in February or

If any of them sprout after that, keep them
cut back and the roots must perish.</p>

one of the most delightful of American poets.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>John Nail, Xenia, Ill.—Your question has been
answered very recently. A husband and wife
cannot, both, make pre-emption or homestead
entries. A married woman can do so only where
she is held to be the virtual head of the family, as
in case of the insanity or imprisonment of her
husband, or abandonment.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A Subscriber, Hobart, Ind.—The proportion of
butter in milk varies with the breed of cattle and
their food. The average is about 5 per cent in
good milk. It is nearer 6 per cent in the milk of
Jersey cows on good feed. The proportion of
butter in cream also varies considerably. It will
average about 5½ pounds of butter to ten of
cream.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>C. S. Hasbrouck, Mendon, Mich.—The ancient
language of the Irish was of Celtic origin, and
specimens of it are still extant in old legal documents.
As a living written language it no longer
exists, but a corruption of it is still spoken
among the natives of the mountain districts.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>S. M., Moline, Ill.—Northwestern Arkansas has
been partially described in another part of “Our
Curiosity Shop” to-day. The more common trees
are the poplar, oak, pine, sycamore, ash, elm, and
hickory. This part of the State is watered by
the White and Arkansas rivers, and their tributaries.
The principal railroads are the St. Louis
and the Little Rock and Fort Smith. Upon the
former the important towns are: Van Buren,
population, 1,029; Fayetteville, population,
1,788, and Bentonville, population, 784; on the
latter, Ozark, population, 824, and Clarksville,
population, 656.</p>

business center, the fewest, 14,770.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>E. H. Topper, Greensburg, Pa.—Historians disagree
as to the number in Xerxes’ army when he
invaded Greece, but no one of them was ever so
insane as to assert that he had 35,000,000 men.
According to Herodotus, the whole number of
fighting men in the military and naval force was
nearly 2,500,000. He supposes, and it was evidently
a wild guess, that with the raw recruits
picked up in passing through the territories of
Thrace, Macedonia, Magnesia, and other half-savage
districts, who hoped to share in the spoils
of Greece, and the servants and camp followers,
there was a total multitude of about 6,000,000
persons. Other Grecian writers regard this as a
gross exaggeration.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>James Dunnoon, Davenport, Iowa—The extent
of the Victoria Nyanza, or great fresh water lake

<hr class="tb">

<p>W. I. Pratt, Tuscola, Ill.—The nickname
“gentle shepherd” belonged to the Hon. George
Grenville (born in 1712), and originated thus:
He was a Whig, and while urging a tax upon cider,
asked his opponents where they would have it.
Becoming excited, he exclaimed: “Let them tell
me where; I repeat it, sir, tell me where;” when
Pitt, who was one of the opposition, raised a laugh
by repeating the words of an old song, “Gentle
shepherd, tell me where.” Your other questions
we cannot answer.</p>

President of the United States, having been
elected with Thomas Jefferson in 1800.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Samuel Burt, Girard, Kan.—The distillery
having the largest capacity in the United States

the world.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>L. D. Crotchett, Edwardsville, Kan.—1. The
salary of United States Senators and Representatives
is $5,000 each. 2. The Vice President

General Brewster, a Congressman is not a
United States officer within the meaning of that
term in certain statutes; but in the broader
sense of the word he is an officer. See definition
of officer in Webster’s Dictionary.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>B. Frank Hoover, Penrose, Ill.—The days you

although they are legal holidays as regards
commercial paper. Saturdays, New Years,
Fourth of July, and Christmas are the only legal
school holidays in Illinois, unless the board of
directors agrees to grant other holidays, which
it has power to do.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>M. L. Karney, Brodhead, Wis.—The Chicago,
Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad pays Mr. Lawler
twenty-five cents for every freight car, and
fifty cents for every coach which he transports
across the Mississippi upon his pontoon bridges
at Prairie du Chien. The company has no other

<hr class="tb">

<p>J. H. Rhodes, Big Rock, Ill.—The Erie Canal,
extending from Buffalo to Albany, has at the
western end an eastern flow for a short distance—from
Buffalo to Seneca River, then a western
flow from Lodi to the Seneca River, and finally
an eastern flow from Lodi into the Hudson
River near Albany. The motion of the water is
greatly moderated by the numerous locks, which
serve to impede the current. The expense of
constructing this canal was much less per mile

<p>R. S., Kill Creek, Kan.—The height of mountains
is determined from the relative height of
the barometer. Ascending from the sea level
the air becomes lighter, and the mercury in the
barometer falls. Civil engineers, knowing the
height of the barometer at sea level, and also at
the place whose height they desire to determine,
are able to compute the elevation of
the place. Other methods are sometimes used.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A. V. Bacon, Lansing, Minn.—The principal
reasons for outgoing trans-Atlantic steamers
from the United States bearing north, are: the
influence of the gulf stream running from the
southern extremity of Florida up the American
coast, making to northeastward between New
Foundland and Ireland; the higher latitude of
the British Isles; and in certain seasons the prevailing
winds. “Imaginary lines” have nothing
to do with their choice of this course. If the
form of the earth was the only thing to be considered,
the steamers would sail on the great
circle connecting the port of departure and the
port of destination, both going and coming, because
such a circle marks the shortest distance
between the two points on the sphere. But winds
and currents are more important than shortest
distances.</p>

<p>E. D. Vorhes, Peotone, Ill.—We believe Whittier
is sometimes referred to as the “bachelor poet,”
but we know of no living poet of distinction referred
to as “the boy poet.” Isaac Watts wrote
verses at a very early age, despite of all the attempts
of his father to reform him of this weakness.
Our own William Cullen Bryant, who was
very fond of declaiming some of Watts’ hymns at
7, 6, and even 5 years of age, began to make
verses of his own at 8 years, and wrote a poem
for a school examination at 10 years, which was
of sufficient merit to become a stock declamation
in other schools. He wrote “The Embargo” and
“The Spanish Revolution” when he was but 13.
Henry Kirke White wrote good poetry before he
was 15, and published a volume of poems when
he was not quite 17. Other “boy poets” there
have been, but who is the “boy poet,” so recognized,
of this prosaic age?</p>

<p>Theodore Wiltz, Dana, Ill.—Yes, “a person who
has resided in the United States but one year, and

He does not need to reside in the country
a year; fifteen minutes is long enough after he
has formally declared his intention to become a

Sam.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Charles W. Collins, Louisville, Wis.—In cases of
simultaneous applications to enter under the
homestead laws, the rule is as follows: Where
neither party has improvements on the land, it
should be sold to the one who bids highest.
Where one has actual settlement and improvements
and the other none, it should be awarded
to the actual settler. Where both allege settlement
and improvements, an investigation must
be had, and the lands awarded to him who shows
the prior actual settlement and substantial improvements,
each as to be notice on the ground to
any competitor.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Inquirer, ——, Kan.—The law making it necessary
for an officer of one State to have a requisition
from the Governor of the same upon the
authorities of another State before he can arrest
and take therefrom any person charged with crime
is designed to prevent persons from being transported
to other States, in some cases far from
home, friends, business interests, to be tried
among strangers, without good evidence that a
crime of some magnitude has been committed.
Similar reasons, but of much less cogency, apply
in support of laws limiting the authority of
sheriffs and constables to the counties to which
they belong, except when armed with special warrants.</p>

by the entire State, instead of a district, in those
States failing to redistrict before the election following
the reapportionment of Representatives
according to the latest census. For instance, the
four additional Representatives given to Kansas
by the last Congressional apportionment were
elected on a general State ticket and not from
single districts. In Maine, where the number of
Congressmen was reduced, the Legislature having
failed to redistrict the State all the Representatives
were elected on a general State ticket.</p>

<p>A Reader, Crete, Neb.—The greater weight of a
body at the poles, as compared with its weight at

force resulting from the revolution of the
earth on its axis, which is zero at the poles and at
its maximum at the equator.</p>

<p>W. Bird, Bolivar, Mo.—The Maas (or Meuse, as

river of Belgium and Holland, which, after
uniting with the River Rhine, discharges into
the North Sea not far from Rotterdam. During
the winter months the Dutch travel and amuse
themselves on skates and runners on the ice of
their many canals, lakes, and rivers, these being
their thoroughfares in winter as well as in summer.
Owing to moderate temperature and an
unexpected rise in the river in the winter of
1512, the ice suddenly gave way at a point on
the Maas, near Rotterdam, and a large number
of people, some say about 8,000, were precipitated
into the water, where the most of them

<p>Phillip Blunn, Seward, Kan.—Fremont in early

by his daring and at times almost reckless adventures
during the explorations by which he
discovered the overland route to California and
opened up the regions of the great Salt Lake and
Upper California to American settlement. He
chafed under the restraints of military discipline,
and was charged with disobeying or exceeding
his instructions, which he sometimes
undoubtedly did: and in his case it nearly
always turned out fortunately for the country.
He was placed under military arrest and found
“guilty of mutiny and insubordination” for acting
as Governor of California by appointment of
Commodore Stockton in 1846, contrary to orders
of General Kearney. The “Old Pathfinder,”
as he was subsequently called, rather gained by

of dower made by any such woman under 21
years of age are of no effect unless ratified by her

county of this State in 1881 was McLean, with a
crop of 9,750,000 bushels; the next largest was
Livingston, with 6,983,522 bushels. The same
year Kankakee County produced 2,743,300
bushels.</p>

<p>R. D. Silsby, Modale, Iowa.—Your friend is

cotton staples are naturally white, but there is
cheap yellow and brownish staple used for nankeen
cloth, and one sort known as Bourbon cotton.</p>

<p>A Reader, Glenwood, Iowa.—1. The great Chicago
fire of 1871 began Sunday evening, Oct. 8,
and lasted until Tuesday morning. 2. Henry
Wilson, the late Vice President, changed his
name, by birth Colbath. Why, he always treated
as a strictly private matter. His childhood was
one of extreme poverty, and he was apprenticed
when he was but ten years old.</p>

<p>Normal Student, Stanbury, Mass.—There is no
State in the Union where a man can vote before
he is 21 years of age. However, if a man’s birthday
is Feb. 1 he becomes of age Jan. 31, as the
law takes no account of fractions of a day in a
matter of this kind.</p>

<p>C. H. Martin, Cheboygan, Mich.—St. Patrick
was sent by Pope Celestine as a missionary to

a deacon in the Church of Rome, and his mother
was a sister of St. Martin of Tours.</p>

<p>A. G. Damson, Vienna, Ill.—W. H. Russell, war
correspondent of the London <cite>Times</cite> during “the

first battle of Bull Run, and prediction of the

<p>Geo. T. L., Attica, N. Y.—The President of
Mexico at this time is General Gonzales; installed
Dec. 1, 1880, for four years. There is a Senate
composed of the Vice President and two members
of each of the twenty-seven States. The House
of Representatives consists of one member for
each 80,000 population, and in 1879 numbered
331. During the recess of Congress a Council of
Government, composed of the Vice President and
half of the Senate, sits, to advise the President.</p>

<p>A. C., Englewood, Ill.—The silkworm spins its
cocoon and passes into the torpid state of a chrysalis
or pupa. If allowed to remain in this state
too long it becomes active, begins to gnaw its way
through the cocoon, and finally comes forth in
the butterfly state. The cocoon is then of little
value. But if, just before the chrysalis begins to
grow active, the cocoons are dropped into boiling
water the insect is instantly killed, and the silk is
easily unwound and reeled for the market.</p>

<p>A. M. A., Union Grove, Ill.—When Governor
Ford’s term as Governor expired, in 1846, he
moved to Peoria and went into the practice of
the law. He had been called from the office of
Associate Judge of the Supreme Court to that of
Governor, but although a good judge, he was not
well suited for an advocate. Moreover, he had
become addicted to overdrinking and during his
gubernatorial term had made many violent enemies
in his own party, some of whom spared no
opportunity to wound him. He had retired from
the Governorship “poorer than when he was inaugurated,”
and failing to secure a remunerative
practice against all the discouragements above
mentioned, he fell into despondency, and died at
Peoria in 1850 in indigent circumstances, but
not “a pauper.”</p>

<p>N. K. Pierce, Mentor, Kan.—The most elegant
Pullman palace cars cost from $20,000 to $25,000,

from $11,000 to $15,000.</p>

<p>Inquirer, LeRoy.—1. The American Almanac for
1883 states the total number of churches in the
United States at 92,477, omitting the churches
of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, which
numbers about 8,000. 2. The membership of all
the Protestant churches is stated at 8,974,400,
and the “adherents” of the Roman Catholic
church at 6,370,858, according to the Catholic
Directory for 1882. Protestant churches enumerate
only those who become members by profession
of faith or letters from other churches;
Roman Catholics enumerate all who have been
baptized in their faith, either in infancy or after
years. 3. Church attendance can only be estimated
from church sittings, which average for the
United States about two and a half times the
membership. 4. The total number of newspapers,
magazines, and other periodicals published
in the United States in the census year is
given as 11,314.</p>

<p>T. L., Winona, Minn.—You are wrong. B wins
the wager, because “a son born to an American

abroad” is in the eye of the law as much an American
as if born in this country, and is eligible to
the Presidency of the United States.</p>

<p>Mrs. S. E. E., Fredericksburg, Iowa—For some
years there was no general agreement as to the
time of observing “Decoration Day,” but when it
became desirable to settle on a specific day to be
kept every year, May 30 having been fixed upon
by one or more Legislatures, it was adopted generally.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Charles Hallas, Adrian, Minn.—1. Congress
raised the salary of the President, by act of March
3, 1873, to $50,000 per annum, at the same time
cutting off certain allowances made to former
Presidents, aggregating several thousands a year.
Before that act the salary of Congressmen of both
houses had been $5,000 and mileage, but by this
act they were raised to $7,500. By act of Jan.
20, 1874, the salaries of Congressmen were reduced
to the old amount.</p>

<p>C. J., Topeka, Kan.—It certainly is customary
when ladies or gentlemen write to any one for information
for them to inclose a postal stamp or
postal card for the reply. It is quite as much as
one should ask of a business man that he take
time to give desired information. To request this
much and expect him to pay postage on the reply
is what is termed in the emphatic vocabulary of
the slang-slinger, “cheeky.” The very fact that
postage is such a trifle makes the omission to inclose
it all the more inexcusable. But while postage
is a mere trifle on the single letter, to a person in a
public position, called on to answer thousands of
questions in a year, the aggregate postage would
be a serious matter were it not for the above rule.</p>

<p>E. J. Bristo.—The whites of Virginia number
880,858; the colored population is 631,616.
That State has one of the most healthful climates
in the world. The water is excellent except in
the swamp regions in the eastern part, and the
soil of about two-thirds of the State is fertile
except where worn out by long tobacco culture
without proper use of fertilizers and alternation
of crops. Virginia can produce anything that
grows in the temperate zone.</p>

<p>Wm. G. Miller, Arkansas City, Kan.; No
method of manufacturing merchantable diamonds
has ever been discovered. A French chemist
claims to have made very minute crystals of
diamond by an extremely expensive process, simply
to prove that the thing is possible, but the
crystals, whether diamonds or not, were of no
value as gems or for any other commercial or
mechanical purpose. For anything more on this
subject see Our Curiosity Shop for 1882, page

<p>Jacob Vanaernam, Mount Morris, Wis.—In Illinois
the State is districted for State representatives,
so that three representatives are chosen
from one district. Every voter may either give
each of the three candidates one vote, or one of
them all three of his votes, or he may give one
and a half votes to each of two of them. This explains
why you saw “half votes” in Illinois election
returns. This system of voting is designed
to place it in the power of a minority party to secure
at least one out of three representatives,
where by the old method all three representatives
might be elected by the majority party.</p>

<p>A. Tyler, DeWitt, Ill.—The Declaration of Independence
was not adopted by Congress until
the 4th of July, 1776, about 2 o’clock p. m., as
fully explained in Our Curiosity Shop some weeks
ago. It was not adopted on July 2. A resolution
was adopted on that day asserting that “these
United Colonies are, and of right ought to be,
free and independent States,” but the Congress
sat the rest of that day, all the next, and a part of
the Fourth, discussing the Declaration before It
was adopted. Some of the delegates to that
Congress never signed it; others not until some
time after July 4.</p>

<p>C. F. S., Denmark, Iowa—The autographic process
of telegraphing, which transmits a facsimile

in 1848 by F. C. Bakewell, of London, England.
It was improved by Abbe Casselli, of
Florence; Lenoir and Meyer, of France, and
Professor Sawyer, of Washington, D. C. It is not
so economical, so expeditions, or so well adapted
in some other respects to ordinary telegraphic
purposes as the Morse system with modern improvements.</p>

<p>A. J., Dern, Ind.—1. The eclectic school

<hr class="tb">

<p>M. K. C., Park, Col.—The air-tube of an argand-burner
lamp should always be open, as its
use is to supply air to the inside of the wick
while other air is being furnished upon the outside.
If the wick be turned too high the oil will
rise in it by the principle of capillary attraction
(not siphon) too rapidly to be properly consumed.
Some of this oil passes off as unconsumed carbon,
and some may drip, in its original form.
2. The amount of carbon in the atmosphere
varies with local circumstances, such as population,
rainfall, sewerage, etc., from 2 to 10 in
10,000 volumes of air. The oxygen and nitrogen
of the atmosphere are invariable in their proportional
parts: twenty-three parts (by weight)
of oxygen and seventy-seven of nitrogen.</p>

<p>Lile E. Argile, Kilbourne City, Wis.—The final
cause of the war of 1812 was the search of American
vessels by the English, and the impressment
of United States sailors into the service of Great
Britain. All of this trouble, however, probably
grew out of the ill-feeling that had existed between
the two nations since the Revolutionary
war. The cause of the Mexican war was the annexation
of Texas to the United States.</p>

<p>S. A. Maxwell, Morrison, Ill.—The term “O
grab me act” was applied to the embargo act of
Dec. 27, 1807. This embargo, laid by our government
on all its own ports and vessels in retaliation
for certain decrees of France and England
sorely restricting the rights of neutral vessels,
bore particularly hard on New England,
which had been increasing its shipping very
rapidly. Inverting the word “embargo,” the
malcontents called it the “O grab me act,” referring
to the fact that it operated to the advantage
of one part of the country at the expense of
the shipping interest in another. These murmurings
grew until the act was repealed in February,
1809. When Congressmen voted themselves
an increase of back salary a few years ago
there was an attempt to transfer the name of O
grab me act to this law.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
